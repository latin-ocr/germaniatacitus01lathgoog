σιτοπομπίαν issi rei Ῥωμαϊκά φροῦριο διοπέμπεσθοι.-Ὺπιόεξόμην μὲν
μοῖραν τοῦ Σολίων ἔθνους, Χαμάέους di Riphaeo—liuhap· ln lixolseg.
Ausonius makes the middle syllable long :

Accedent vires, quas Francia, quasque Chamaves
Germanique tremunt—Mosella, 434.

'Phe branch of the Germanic population to which the original
Chamavi belonged, was almost certainly the Old Saxon.

Amongst the obscurent of the traditionsry heroes of the Westpha·

The present town of Enyern, near Herford, in westphalia, the
supposed scene of Varus's defeat, probably preserves the name, and
fines tho locality os the Angrivarii. But the area was a wide one.

That this identityis not tahon up on light grounds is shown by
the following extracta.

Insignita quibus Saxonis floruit olim ;
Nomina nunc remanent, virtus antiqua recessit.
Denique Weatsalos vocitant in parte manentes
Occidua, quorum non longe terminus amne

A Rheno distat: regionem solis ad ortum
