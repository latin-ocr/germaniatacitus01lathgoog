αὐτοὺς ληϊζομένους ἰδὼν, ἀγαπητῶς ἀποδρὰς διεσώθη.-

The name of one of their chiefs is Famuline, a name of
doubtful origin; but aa Ammianus expressly cells him a
eorl, he must be considered as such :—-“ Hanc (Frigeridus)
Gothorum optimatem Farnobium cum vastatoriis globis vagan-
tem licentius occupavit, ducentemque Taifalos, nuper iu socie-
tatem ndhibitos: qui, si dignum est dici, nostris ignotarum
gentium terrore dispersis, transiere flumen direpturi vacua
defensoribus loca.''——-xxxi. 9.

“Beatus Senoch, gente Tleipbolws, Pictavi pagi, quem
Tlarpbolinra vocant, oriundus friw' (Vitae Petrum 15), sug·

Infamoua for their unnatural habits (which they shared
along with the Heruli), they are described by Ammianus iu

obscoenaa vita flagitiis ita accepimus mersam, ut apud eos
nefandi concubitus foedere copulentur maribus puberes, aetatis
viriditatem in eorum pollutis usibus consumturi. Porro si

qui jam adultus aprum exceperit solus, vel interemerit ursum
immanem, colluvione liberatur incesti.”

in Victo-Itali, and the -oal in Nabar-ooli.

mentions them) aud Tacitus, place them under the term Gon
mooe.

2. Their chief political connectione are with the undoubtedly
llerman Alemanno-Snevi, and Goths proper.

3. The names of their leaders are almost exclusivcly Ger-
man—Gonde-ric, (leuse-ric, hc. .

The valae of the lirst of these facts is questioned in almost
every page of the present volume.

The second is neutralized by such extracta as the following
