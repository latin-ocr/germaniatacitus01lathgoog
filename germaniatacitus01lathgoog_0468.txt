The third is a really substantia} reason, and would be valid
if there were nothing to set against it.

Against it, however, stand,—

l. The nome of the people themselves, which is pro
bably a Sonth-German form of the well-known root,
aad, applied by the Germans in general to the Slavonians
in general.

2. The locatitias. In no part of the true and undoubted
Germanic area do we meet with any form of the root V-ndl,
and no where do we lind the mention of them as Germanic,
, other than cursory and incidental. Neither Pliny nor Tacitus
gives ns more than the name.

3. The different points of the Roman frontier, upon which
we meet with Vandals, are so distant, as make it likely that
the populatiou, known hythe name Vendat, was of great
extent3 whilst great extent on the partos a populationis

Hence, Ι believe that the Venedi of the Germans of the
Baltic, were the Vacci-uli of the Germane of the Danube,
and oica carad.

Of these Slavonio populations, thus known nndsr aGer·

1. The Vondola of the DaooPanuonian frontier, whose
scene of action was the Middle aud Lower Danube, whose
political relations were with the Goths proper, and who first
became formidable to the Romans under their German name
during the Marcomannic war. The ethnological affinities of
these were more specially with the hyali, and their present
representatives are the more southern brauches of the Poles,
along with some of the more northern Slovaks.

2. Vandals of the south-westem frondea—These, more
important than the others, were the Sorabians of Saxony,
Silesia, and the more eastern parts of Thuringia and Fran-
oonia; ia, the Slavonians ol' the Upper Maine, the Upper
albe, and the Saale, their scene of action being in the first
