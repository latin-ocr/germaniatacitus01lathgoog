preceding remarks.

The Maporhyyoc of Ptolemy, on the Thuringian frontier,
were Burgundian.

But these Maporitwm arc Mcrooioyc’ooo.

Hence, the Meroviogians of Franco are Merovingians,
not because they were the Merovingians of the conquerere of

Alterum genus Ingaevones, quorum pars Gimhri, Teutoni ac

pars Oimhri mediterranei Hermiones, quorum Saevi, Her·
mundari, Ohatti, (lherueci. Quinta pare Peucini, Basternae

is eomewhat strange fora people of Franconia. Ite proper clas·

To this it may be added, that there are several isolated
actione, such as a contest with the Goths, aud another with
Fastida‚ king of the Gepidae, which give ue Burgundiones too
far down the Danube, to leave the history of the Burgundians
of Burgundy eo simple,ae it was left in the chapter referred to.
ln other words. there must be either migration or another
populatiou called· Borpnrtdhro.

The second alternative seems pret'erab103 indeed the exist
ence ol such asecond populationis eo certain, that the question
is, not whether there were two Burgundies, but which of the
two it was thet Fastida (or the Gotho) fought against, and
which it was that Pliny meant hy Burgundiones.

o. I think that these two were the same.
