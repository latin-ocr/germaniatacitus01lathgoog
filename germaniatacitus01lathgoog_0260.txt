In another now aud peculias point of new, the Frisians claim
notice. Their history is, to o certain extent, aphyea'ccl history.
Many branchos oi the stom to which they belong have boen lopped
off bytho hand of man, by war, by lamine, by oppression bravoly
withstood. But others have given way to a strongor and moro
unconquorablo power-that oi Nature. It is the Frisian area that
most of the great inundations oi tho North Sea have broken iu
upon. What Vesuvius has beon to Campania, AEtna to Sicily, Hoola
to Iooland, tho Oceau has been to Frisia.

The proper complement to tho othnology of this brooch, would
be the physical history of the North Soa 3 and this is what (lle-
mons, tho bost investigator of the least known part of tho family
-tho North Frisians-has skotohod.

The Frisians have over boen tho poople of a retirtoq srorstier,
aa, whilst others hawo encroaohed on their oocupanoios, thoy have
novor, within the historioal period, been successful invaders aud
permanent aggressors elsewhere. Not, at least, by land. By ssa,
tho caso may have boon different, so different, that in our own
island much that pasees sor AngloSaxon in origin may bo Frisiau ;
a matter tc which a special notice has beon dedicated*

On the west tho Ooonn, on tho north the Dauos and bow Gor-
mans 3 on the south tho Low Germane have boen tho encroaohers.

Tho lact of tha Frisians having thus suffered from encroaoh-
nrent, rather thau gained by aggression, has a practical bearing.

Frisian oocupancy may be inferrod from certain charmteristios,
hereafter to be illustrated: and theso characteristico we find in
localities far beyond tho present Frisian area. Now, had the
Frisians boen a family oi conquerors, tho inforeuco would be that
the introductiou was recent, and that, upon sorno earlier oocupancy,
Frisian eloments might have been‘ engraltod. But as the truth is
tho reverso of ahis3 as tho Frisiaus have habitually retrooted rather
than adrancod, the conclusion is different, and as Frisiann amos os
geographical localities—lor of this sort are tha characteristico in
question-may reasonably bo assumed to denoto Frisian oocupauoy
anterior to that of the present dominant populatiou.

of all the ancient names of Gomon populations, the torm Frisii
has beon the most permanent. hess altered inremuneratum
