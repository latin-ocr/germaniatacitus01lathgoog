Francorum, ire may simply suppose them to be Franks of
adiffereut division of the Frank name.

All that follows from the proposed latitudo given to the
name Marruuium, follows from the proposed latitudo given
to the name Frank.

Indead, if wa look at their geographical distribution, we
shall find that the Franks were the Marcum of the Roman*
frontier; and Ι submit to the reader the doctrine, that
they called themselves Franks because they were so, is, in
oppositiou to their follow-Germana, who vvere subject to
Rome.

A German of the Decumates agri was not a Frank (though
he might be an Alcmona), because he was not really fros.

The Burgundian of the interior country was nol a Frmsk.
Really srsc lr'ewas; hut as hisfreedom was uot contrasted
with the dependence of his neighbours, it was not necessary

What is gained by the hypothesis? To say nothing about
the minor migrations, it gets over (amougst others) the lol-
louing great difficulty.

The Franks of Franconia are Hlplsr those of the Lower
Rhiue, Low Germane.

Such the hypothesis.

I. Tlos Franks of tls southern stuariam—Probus had to deal
with both Alemanni and Franks. It is protollo that these
were the Franks of Franconia.

The Franks whom Aurelian chastised‚ were certainly so;
and, upon the whole, Ι think it is these Franconian Franks
(the Franks of the Upper Rhiue) who appear earliest
in history. Even if they do not, they appear far too soon
to have the name accounted for by any conquests or migra-
tions; moveruents either way, from the Upper to the Lower‚
or from the Lower lo the Upper Illinc, involving equally
great, though different difficulties.

The measure of the southern, or Franconian Frank oon·
quest, is to be found iu the name Francius-(lomes this being
to them as Alsatia is to the alemanno-Susurri, and Bur-
gundy to the Burgundiaus.
