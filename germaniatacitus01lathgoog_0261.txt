compared ιο Herse, and applied to the population os its original area,
it deuotes the Frisii of Tacitus, the present Friedandersof Friesland,
with a sninimum amount os alteration.

As to whether tho name itself ιο German, it would be an unne-
cessary refinement ιο doubt it. N evertheless, the criticism which
applies ιο ιιο word Sesti is applicable ιο Frisii also. It is applica·
te, but, although applicable, it by no means follows that it should
be applied. By considering tho term as Kellia a few difficulties re·
specting the connection between the Frisii and Chauci might, per-
haps, ιο removed. On the other band, we hare Pliny’s word Frisia-
toacs ,¹ a oomponnd almost certainly German.

'Phe shadow of uncertainty that rests orer the language to which
the root Fris· belongr, is created by tho fact os the Frisii being
mentioned by Cesar, under the name now before us: for Gaesar's
informants were Gaulo, and, l am inclined to think that, as ο persc-
ral roste, the Gallio name osa Germanic populetion was different
from the native one.

Again 3 the name of the national hero is so osten the neme of the

the case, a slight presumption is raised against the name being

indigemus, native, aud 'vernacular- 'lhis is the case here. 'l'he
great mythological Frisian is Fica. We should expect some ench
name as Fris.

Thus, in the Traveller's Song, we have-

All this, however, may be, and probably is, over-retinement.

Τιο later form which the word Frisii takes is one in -a-, the so·
called went form of the Gothic grammarians. Hence, whilst Tacitus,
Pliny, Ptolemy, and Dion, write Frisii, Φρίσσιοι, and Φρείσιοι, Proco-
pius hss Φρίσοονες.

'lhe Anglo-Saxon writers also use the form in -au ,· ey, Fresones
in Beda, and Frison in tho AngloSaxon Chroniclo.

une form Faria-dones, in Pliny, has been already uotioed. Itis
clearly a compound. 'Pho power and original form of the second
