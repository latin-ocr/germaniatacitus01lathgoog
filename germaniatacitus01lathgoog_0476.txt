p. 465.

Pliuy's evidence is the earliest. He places them on the
Baltic rather than elsewhere. “ Nec minor opinione Eningia.
Quidam haec habitari ad Vistulam fluvium a Sarmatis,
Venedis, deiris, Hirris, tradunt.”

The first complication here occurring, is the similarity of ·

the names Him' and sris. Strange that really different
populations, with names so alike, should occupy contiguons
localities. No other writer mentions the Hirri, aud 1 think
they are but Soirr‘ under another nume-is, a name taken
from a different dialect.

Neither does any other writer place any deiri in the north.

The Olbian Inscription mentions the Σκίροι, along with
the Γάλαται.

Stephanus Byzantinus speaks of Σκίροι, Γαλάτικον ἔθνος.

Procopius joins tho Σκίροι with the Goths aud Alans.

J ornandes mentions the deiri as either subjecte or allies
of Odoaoer.

If we take these statements without criticum, we lind
difficulties that even the assumption of migratione will not
account for; since, although a mosoment from the Baltic
to the Danube, between the time of Pliny and Procopius,
will account lor their presence on that river, it is of no avail
for the Scire? of the Olbian Inscription-which is generally
referred to a period anterior to the time of Pliny, ia, the
first or second century no.

Sidonius makes the Scire? part of Arria's army.

J ornandes connects them with the Alam-“Sari et Sa·
tagarii et ceteri islanorum, cum duce suo, nomine Caudex,
Scythiam minorem, inferioremque Moesiam accepere.”—-·De
Reb. Get. 49, 50.

The evidence ol Jornandes is important, since Peria, the
notary of (landas, was his grandfather.

Now, as we are much surer of the Sciri of Jomaudes on
the Danube, than ol those ol Pliny, their ethnology will he
considered first.
