against them; so they were when, presred by the Huus,
they besought Valens to allow them to pass the Danube; so
they were when Hermanric’s kingdom was consolidated,
and so they were until they invaded Macedonia, lllyri-

011 the Gothic families their migratione were the most cousi·
derable.

lt was a longono that took them from Germauy 10 the
country 01 the Getae. It was a longer one which carried
them from tho country 01 the Getae to Spain.

Of all the Gothic tribes the Gotho Proper have most
merged their nationality in that 01 the countries which they
invaded. In Graece, iu Italy, iu Southern Gaul, and in
Spain, 00 Gotho are to be found asa separate substantive
people; and no known dialect definitely and uuequivocally
represents the old Moeso-Gothic. On the Lower Danube
itself, the Goths 01 the Grimea, now uo longer distinguished
by their German tongue, and, consequently, no longer easily
distinguishable from their neighbours, are their sole represen-
tatives —if such they can now be called. Iu Germany itself,
the mother-country, from which eren at the beginning 01 their
history they were already separated, the Thuringian dialect is
supposed to be the most Gothic; but this—a statement made
by Michaelis—has yet to be definitely confirmed.

were connected in other attributes 010ος ia, whether they

were really Goths, or only populations with a nominal resem-
