the Romans, who advaneed as far as the westward, though

they did uot make any conquesta. ln 740 the Romans
attached the Germana both on the Danube and on the Lower
Rhine. The lact that such attacks were never made on the
Upper Rhine, as far down as the river Lahn, shows that
Suebis was not then aGerman country; it did not become
one until the Alemanni settled there. All we know about
this war is regne and indefinite, and the account in Dion
casius is unfortunately mutilated. It may have been in
these campaigns that, as my friend Roth conjectures, Domi-
tius Ahenobarbus penetrated into Germany across the Elbe
in Bohemia; lor, in the subsequent invasione, we mostly find
the Romans marching towards the Elbo from the Lower
Rhine. The war was conducted by Tiberius* younger
brother, Nero claudius Drusus, in three campaigns. He
advanced from the Lower Rhine across the Weser, as far as
the Elbe, and subdued the Bructeri, Sigambri (who πετο

country; lor they had no fortified places, and, when they
met the Romans iu the open held, they were usually beaten,
being unable to resist the military skill ol the Romans.
Their country was now ravaged3 women and children were
carried off into slamry, and the men were put to death like
wild heasts; for, although Drusus was otherwise of a mild
disposition, considering what the Romans then were, yet he
was, like Varus, a great sinuer (ἀλιτήριος) towards the
Genusus. He died in his ¹camp, not without a suspicion
of Tiberius having caused his death ς but this may have been
believed only ou account of the hatred which Tiberius enter·
tained against tho family ot' his brother, especially against
Germanicus. All that Tiberius could have feured was, that
Drusus, like Germanicus, might indulge iu the sair dream of
restoring the republic.

111745, alter the death of Drusus, Tiberius took the
commaud; and his triumph over the Germane was followed
by his withdrawal to Rhodes. During the seven years of
