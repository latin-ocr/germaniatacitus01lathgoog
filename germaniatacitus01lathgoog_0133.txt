sacrificed to the gods of the Germana, who offered human
sacrifices for the purpose of ascertaining the future. Three
legions, with as many alae, and ten coborts, were cut to
picces; but, owing to the unfortunate dividuus among the
Germane, they were unable to make that nse of their victory
which Arminius would otherwise have undoubtedly have
made. Many of the Roman castella, however, were taken
aad destroyed; aud much else may have been done, which
tbc Roman accounts of this catastrophe passed over in
silence!

The details in Strabo are fewer than we expect.

They are also those of a Greek and it must be remem-
bered that it was only through the Romans that the Greeks
knew much of Germany; iu other words, their knowledge
was second-haud.

Hence, the distinction between a Gaul and a Gemina, so
clear to a Roman wne far from being equally clear to a Greek.

This remark baa been mede by Grimm, but without being
acted on. Yet the practical bearing of it is important.

Even such a writer as (laesar does not wholly confine his
account of Germany to what he had himself observed. On
the contrary, he quotes Eratosthenes, aud indicates the
opinions of other Greeks. Pliny's account is pre-emineutly
Greek, whilst Tacitus has evidently, iu more places than oue,
allowed his reading to stand in the place of first-hand iuvesti-
gation. Yet the Greeks were no safe guides; not because
they had no powers of observation‚ but because it was impos-
sible for them to know such n country as Germany without
coming iu contact with Germane. Still they knew something
of it. They knew that it was the land of a certain stock,
family, ornation that came nuder certain negative conditione.

The German was not a Scythica, in tho way that the
nativos of the Don were.

Nor an Illyrica, as a Taulantiau was.

Nor a Samariae, ns the «Iazyges were.
