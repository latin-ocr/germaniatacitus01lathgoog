Thirdly, mixed with Platt·Deutsch forms ol' differant descriptione.

The distribution, however, to as fur as it has hitherto gone, has
applied to tha Gontinent only, not to the islands.

In those of the North Seu, or those on the western sida, it is ae
follows:

a. In Iliibr (which from being central it is convenient to begin
with) we have Dum-um, Uttersum, Hedehus-um, Vite-um, N iebel-um,
Buldilrs-um, Vrelrs-um, Oevenswm, hildi-um, Allieno-um, Berge-um,
Nostrum, Klintum, Olds-um, iluna-lem.

b. In Sylt, Horu-um, Mors-um, Aries-um, Keil-um, Tinn-um-ali

c. ln sterilem Romii, hoscum.

d. ln Fano, nono. ·

e. s. 9. ln Amr-iim (to the mulleos Sylt), in Pelvorm‚ andin Nord-

If wc now look back upon the distribution oi local names in the
Gimbric peninsula, wo shall lind that-

αΊ Thero is e part purely Frisian, ie, the parts between T'ondcrn
and Husum.

b. A part mixed with Danish, i.e., North Jutland.

c. Apart mixed with PlettDeutsch, ie, Ditmarsh3 and, besides
these-

d. Parte where thare is an intermixture of differant degrees os
complexity oi Frisian, Danish, and PlettDeutsoh.

Now in tha parts about Husum, i.e., the parts where the audinga
ure most purely Frisian, the laapuuqe isat tle present moment
Frisios—the North Frisian so-callad. I have heard it spoken,
and, imperfeotly spoken it, myself this very year.

And in the islands ottho North Sea, und many parts about it, there
either is North Frisian, or, has been so, within the memory oi man.

And in Eyderstod and Ditmarsh it has been so within tho his·
toricul period.

Is this Frisisn new or oldl Have the populatione who speek it
