These with the secoud cespirnted (Cuncti, Κοῦχοι) occur in
Velleius Paterculue, Spartianus, Ptolemy.

Dion (lessius hes eon forms Χοῦκις end Καῦχοι.

Lucan and Olsudien divide the vowels ond make them trisyllabic.
This division os the vowelsis of some importunos iu the history of
ethnologicsl conjecture, since it brings the forms Ooy'lci end cauci to
aresemblsnce with the Καοῡλκοι of Strabo, and then with the curun.

The (lhsuci fell into two divisione-tho (lhsuei minores between
the Eme sud Weser, tho Chauci majores between the Weser sud Elbe.

It is sete to identify thern with the Hoc-iupus of the Trevellsr’s
Soug ond Beowulf-the termination -s'ny being s patronymic, the
-os the sign of the plural number, end the cle in Chauci equivaleut
to b in the seme wey thet 0t=H in otoni und Herse.

lt is saie, too, to consider the Chauci ss members of the Frisisn
section oi the Gothic stock.

In the battle of Finneshurh, Hnoefi the eponyrnus of the Hauo-
veriam, theson os Finn, the son of Folcwslds, hes, es his queen,
Hildeburg, the Hoc-icy. I do not consider thet this gives us any·
thing historioal. All thot it does is to connect the Chauci and
Frisii (Hoc-inps andd’ruioru) by certsin politicsl relations ; snd
carry the ores oi their legendary locelities as far as Hsnover snd
Hildesheim.

considerable difficulties ere involved in the statement that the
(lhsuci extended osser ss the frontier of the (lhstti ς difficulties turn-
ing upon the relstionship between the Old Ssxon end the Anglo
Sexon langusgss.

1f we join the (lhsuoi end Chatti, we do one oi two things3 vve
either-

o. Disoonnect the country of the Old-Ssxons of Westphslia from
that ottho Augu-Saxone : or else we-

b. Enclose two such important populations as the Old Ssxons and
Anglo·Saxons within too small sn cres.

Two other points connected with the ethnography of the Chauci
still stand over.

1. The discrepsmcy between 'lucitus ond Pliny es to their physicsl
and politicsl condition. What 'llscitus says may be seen in the
text. It is much the seme us Velleius Paterculus hed ssid before ε-
“Receptae (leuchorum ustiones ς omnis eorum juventus, infinito
numm,i1nmsnss corporibus, situ locorum tutissime, traditis ermis
. . ente imperatoris procubuit tribunal?
