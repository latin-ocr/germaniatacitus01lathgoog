§xnvnn ran saxone.

The hypothesis respecting the Saxone is aa follows :-

The name Suara was to the Kolta of Britain, what Ger-
man was to those of Gaul.

0r, if not, what Suae was-a name somewhat more
specillo.

Ιι probably applied to the Germana of the seu-coast, and
the water-systema of the Lower latine, Weser, Lower Bibe,
and Eyder; to Low Germane on melthias, ιο Frisians and
Saxons on the Eine, and to North Frisians on the Eyder.

All the Angles were Saxone, bnt all the Saxona were not
Anglea

The reasoning in favour of this view ia as follows :—

That Soron was a Britannia term is undenied. The
Welsh and Gaels eall us dueum at the present moment.

The Romans would take their name for certain Germane,
aa they found it with the Britona.

The Britons and Romans using the same name, would he
aa two to one in favour of the Keltio name taking ground.
lt would he the Roman and Keltio against a German name
single-handed.

The only question is, whether the name Suana was aeoles-
sinely Britannia (ΚοΙιίο), i.e.‚ not German also.

In favour of the word being German, are two facts-

l. The thorough adoption of the root Saeua, aa denoted
not only by the use of German writers, hut hy its appear-
ance in ras-eo, Wea-sou, Sua-seu, Middleseo. The reason-
ing that appliee to Suari, appliee here.

2. The name Soa-nem, aa a deity, whom the Old Saxona,
on their eonversion to Christianity‚ w'ere compelled ιο for·
swear. This gives us the lihelihood of its being the name of
an opooynsus. I admit that this is rogent, but not that it ia
mnolusive.

3. The story about ninwp oerore Soaoa=tuke yorw dopyera
and the deduction from it, that Suom meant deppae-men, is of
no great weight; with the present writer at least. still, aa

far as it goes, it is'something. ᾖ
