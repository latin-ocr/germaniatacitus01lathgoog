ln one respect Ι may appear to have understated
the case that can be made out by the advocates of
what may be called the German theory in its broadest
form. One of the strong arms of their argumentis,
the etymological deduction of names litassent, Lyyii,
&c., from supposed German roots. Specimens of
these derivatione may be found incidentally through-
out the work. In the eyes of such readers as they
satisfy,I have done less than justice to the viewa of
their devisers. But, if the samples· in question be
(as they are believed to be) fair specimens of the
whole, I have but little fear that the neglect of thern
will lay me open to the charge of keeping back any
very valid arguments on the opposite side.

It should be added that the order in which
the different geographical and national names of the
Epilepomeaa are taken is what may be called hrpical,
cla, those populations which illustrate each other, and
which are subject to the same lines ol mitialem, are
groupad together, sometimes (but not often) to the
violation of geographical proximity‚ and ethnological
