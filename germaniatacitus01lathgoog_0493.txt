from the round-system of the different Slavonic languages

Thus, the sounds akin to the 9 in pua, and the kin lind, are .,

not equally distributed over the Bohemian, the Polish, the

Russian, and the Lithuanic. No Slavonic tongne hae the ’

four soupds of y, lc, kt, and l. Each has two or three of
them. hus-

Βοιεοιιοη k · kh hwitt gwanting.
Losorion k · kh h „ gwanting.
Bursian k g kh - „ twenting.
Pok'rl k g kh - „ twanting.
Bulgorion k g kh - „ twenting.
illyrico k g - · „ ktandkwanting.
Littuom'c k g - - ‚‚ ktandkwanting.
'latrat k g - · „ ktandtwanting.

Hence, where the Poles say p, the Bohemians say l,-
whereas the Bossian spells such foreign words as Hor-old and
Hortum, Gerold and Grroop; thare being no sign for l. So
that if a Bohemian aud Lusatian wished to prononnce such a
name as Gal, as a Pole prononnced it, he would fail in doing
so, and say Hot instead; and oisc arrad, a Lett would
change Hot into θοι.

Ι admit that these facts require the initial in the words
Jotae, and Jotlmrp, ιο be H rather than J.† On the other
hand, Ι think that, as H is the modern form, J may have
been the older one; in other words, that the change fromp
ιο h may not have been direct and immediate, bnt as fol-
lows :-9, j (y), l.

Ι submit that these remarks are sufficient reasons for the
existence of sorm differencs at least in the forms of the names
in question, if not for the exact differences which we actually
lind. Thus much concerning the change from g to j (y).

The one from j to o can, in like manner, be shown ιο be

no arbitrarp⁷ assumption, but a true and proper letter-change
’ of the Slavonic-Lithuanic languages.
