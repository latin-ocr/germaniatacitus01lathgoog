History only telle us of German amice having advanced

But if the area of the dispoesssesd Germane was thus
remarkable, that of those who held their ground was not
less so.

Along the Danube there was, at the time of Tacitae, a
real existence pf Germane to the south of Bohemia end
Moravio, and it extended so far eastwards as to come within
the same degree of longitude as the supposed Gothe of the
Baltic. The Germane of the Danube were the Marcomanni ;
perhaps the Quadi3 aud almost certainly, some of the ances-

century.

Now these kept their ground, being the only ones that are
admitted to have done so. They did more; they encroachsd
permaneutly on their neighbonrs to the east. Strange, that

thus have preserved those Germane of the Danube against
those fierce Slavonians who (if we suppose the Lygii to have
been Germane, and the Marcomanni to hare occupied all
Bohemia) so thorongbly exterminated their brethreu to the
north. It looks es if the fact of their having been personally
engaged in warfare against Rome, had so sharpened their
swords as to have endowed them with powers of resistance
unknown north of the Bohemian frontier. Everywhere else
the Germane retired3 between Bohemia and the Danube
they encroaehed.

Yet it was not for want of enemies that they thus kept
their ground. Theirs was no locality especially favoured by

ancestors of the Ostrogoths and Vieigoths should have held
out against these odds. Ιι is strange that they should have

in history which may be read differently; and instead of
