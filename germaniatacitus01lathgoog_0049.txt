They can he brought from no point nearer than the water·
system of the Dnieper. Yet the water-system of the Dnieper
will not give us the phanomenon required. The language of
that river is eminently homogeneous (Russian); whilst the lan-
gnages of Saxnny, silesia, Bohemia‚ Poland‚ Pomerania, and
Brandcnburg„ although all Slavonic‚ are spoken in nume-
rous dialects and sub-dialects. Το derivo all this from the
Dnieper is to deduce the whole from the part, the old from
the new.

We have now taken a measure of some of the improbabili·
ties involved in the doctrine os a Slavonie migration to the
Transalbian portion of the Germania, between the times of
Tacitus and Oharlemagne; and though they are undeniahly
great, their magnitude is only relative; and a certain degree of
evidence may overbalance them. Difficult as it is to believe
that Poland was ever Germanic, there is, nerertheless, an
amount of testimony which would make it oredible. Had an
observor like Oaesar visited the country ie person, and known
it as well aa he knew Gaul, his dictum would, probably, have
outweighed all other difficulties. On the other hand, had a
writer of no character whatever classed it amougst the coun-
tries of Germany, Ι should have troubled the reader with but
few reasons for objecting to him, and have disposed of his
evidence in a summary manner, hy treating his statement as
an error.

The authority of Tacitus is intermediate to these two
extremes.

Implicit and uncritical belief is not always the highest tri-
bute of respect. So far from finding any morbid feeling of
pleasure in taking exceptione to the statements of a great
writer like Tacitae, Ι have no hesitation in saying‚ that the
more I have criticised the more Ihave found to admire. So
numerous are the cases where an unscrutinizing adoptiones
his statements only mystifies us! Whereas the admission of
the slightest amount of falhbility gives us an important fact.
Such, amongst others, is the statement concerning the lan-
guage of the AEstyii, andos the Gothini (vid. nott. in οο.)

More than this‚the very latitude given to the term Germania,
though wrong as far as the facts which it implies are con-
