N ow what il thia division os the Oroatiana he asold ιι ιλι time of
Tacitual and what il t'he Germana translated thouarno in early times,
eren ιι ιλι Τιιλι did afterwardsl In this oasa tho name Oai repre-
senta the German Weioa= thr, and the oo· are the err'te Oroatians
uhder their German name, and Wisberg (O'o'irtoo'pyror of Ptolemy)
ia Wha‘tahill (or toron), and even the mysterioue ask-tourytur Mona
is Weiotrry.

No objections against this lie iu the ouwent notion that the Sla-
voniana ol the Danube did not make their appearanoe in history till
the sixth oentury-the notion itsels being not only objectioneble,
but almost certainly incorreot. All that we fairly gat from the eri·
donee ol Prooopiua and others is, that it was the sixth century when
the populations of tho Lower Danube λιοιιιι known aa soronam,-
just as it was ιλι third when the Westphalian and Hanoverian
Germana λιιιιιι known ιι Saxone, or those os the Lower Rhine ιι
Fraaba, and just aa three populations out of four throughout the
world are known at different periodo ol their history by different
narnea. The reasonable suggestion ol Zanes that tha Aravisci
are the population ol the Raab, is a real complication. So is
the name of the river Οιιιιιι in the probable territory ol the
Ort.

The complanent to this note is not. in v. Osi in the aequal.

That Oa= Weia is, perhaps, by discis, unlikely.

Τλιι Araviar :Hlarooitsb is also, perhaps, ty daelf, unlikely.

But that a part ot* the Arauisci oalled Oai, should = Weiase Hlaru-
vr'aclre is aot unlikely—the eridenoe being ol the sort oalled carrula-
tr'oe, where two small probabilities make one great one.
