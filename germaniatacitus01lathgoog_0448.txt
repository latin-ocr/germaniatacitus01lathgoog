urrnenounar. lxix

Gallias appetunt, egressique ad terras papiam unum de regno
Theodorici devastant atque captivant, oneratisque navibus
tam da captivis quamde reliquis spoliis reverti ad patriam
cupiunt. Sed rex eorum in litus residebat, donee naves
altum mare comprenderent, ipse deinceps secuturus; quod
cum Theodorico nuntiatum fnisset, quod scilicet regio ejus
fuerit devastata, Theodebertum, filium suum, in illas partes
cnm valido exercitu ac magno armorum apparatu direxit.
Qui, interfecto rege, hostes navali praelio superatos opprimit,
omnemque rapinam terrae restituit.”-iii. 3.

Now from Beowulf we learn that the papas of the Franks
who killed Hipalao was that ot' the Her-om.

In a document of nn. 769, we lind—“Silva quae vocatur
Haase, in aquilonari parte fluvii Rurae.''

Later still we lind the form Hera, and, at the present
moment, there is a town called Heia-ingen, on the right bank
os the Ruhr, between Eeseo aud Werdenfi

These names, then, as well as that of the town of Enseu,
give us the eren of those Germane who were called in Platt-
Dentsoh-

a. Chattuarii, or Ati-uarii.

b. In High German Haazoarii.†

Whose neme also was either compound or simple, ia,
Chattuarii or alacri, Hazzoarir' or Heaaa,· this latter form
being preserved in the present formidamur which is High
German in respect to the aa, but Old Saxon in respect to the
omission ol the initial aspirato.

ln Tacitus (Anu. i. 50, 51) we lind a notice of the Siloa
Coeia, the locality of the Marsi, eud the seat of the worship
of the dea Tacfaoa.

This looks like the name of the country about Eseaa in its
oldest forms.

The connection between the Marsi, Gambrivii, audather
populations belonging to the Sicambriaa division, with the
Chattuarii, is somewhat doubtful.

The name may hare originated in the root an- ol the
siloa Casia, and so have been older than that of the popula·

* D. S. ii. 6·20.’ † But not Hor-uarii=Char·unrii.
