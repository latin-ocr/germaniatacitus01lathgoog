¹ Boram-cesar places the Batavi in the island formed by the
Meas, Vhael, and Rhiue, ‘¹ Mosa, parto quadam ex Rheno recepta,
qua appellatur Vahalis, insulam efficitBatavorum.”-Bell.Gall. inlu.

'Phe caer-Baua aud Neder-Betcwc still preserve the name.
Probably, they also fix the locality.

This is considerably distem from Hasce, the centra os the Chatti.

Nevertheless, the origin ascribed to the Batavi hy Tacitus matthe
taken aa we liud it.
· Upon the principle oi cousideriug all migratione along a navi-
gable water-course, where the population os the intermediate parts
differs from that oi the extremities, as fluviatih, I consider that the
Batavi came from the country of the ataui iu boats. Still, Hesse is
ou the Weaer rather than on the Rhiue.

Hitherto there are but few complicatione.

A slight difficulty arisae from certain passages in Dion. He
speaks ol the merite aud numbers os the Bataviau maulay. This
is not what we expect from the occupante ol a small island.

A gramm arises when we try to reconcile the statement oi Tacitus
with the present state of the Dutch lauguage. The Dutch of
Holland is a Platt-Deutsch dialect, nowhere more so than in Over
and Neder Betuwe

The language ol the Hessiaus (or modern Chatti) is High German.

Agaiu-the name Bataui extended further than the insule (in-
mloe) Batauorum, at least as early as the time os Ptolemy3 since
that writer mentions heyden=llocyddunor Βαταέῶν. Now onyo'·
δεινον (lugdunum) ie not only Kaltic iu respect tc its terminatiou
dunum, but was also the name of the unequivocally Gallio town

Lycus (Lag-danum).
