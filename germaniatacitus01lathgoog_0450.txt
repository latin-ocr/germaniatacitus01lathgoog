been removed from the lower Rhine ιο Burgundy, ae colo-
niats, aad ιο have settled on the Douba.

From the end of the eighth century downwarde, the naticae
of apayae, and comitatus Aaaariorraa are numeroua—the
locality being the valleys of the Vincenne, Tille, and Bene,
and the neighbouring parts oi the water-system of the
Doubs.

The papas Commaaaram joined the pagus Aaaartoraa on
tha Doube, even as the areae of the Ohamaaa' and Attuarii
were conterminans on the Lower Rhine. For the numerous
references to these interesting settlements, ece Zeuss, pp. 582
-58a They deservo more attention from local antiquariae
than they have found.

Ill. The Χαιτούωροι cy* Paterna—This writer, who says
nothing about any Chattuarii on the Lower Rhine‚ places a
population with a name ao like it as Χαιτ-ούωροι on the part
between the Upper Rhine and Danube, amongst the Dan-
dati, Turones, Merovingi‚ and other widely different sections
of the Germanic population; and, to add to the confusion,
he places Κοσ-ουάροι οοι very far from Χαιτ-ούωροι.

Is this ιο be pat down ιο erroneous information, and to
pass aa inaccuracyt Probably. At the earne time an
intrusiones Chatti, from the southern portion of their area
may have taken placa, and the name alasa, or ammae
(Hazai or Haza-carii) have thus originated. The Low
German form in ·t-, however, is against this view.

The fact of an inaccuracy is the likelier.

l. aa Saenius dualia—The name of the country called
Suabia is a true ethnologiaal term, even as Fraaaaaia is one.
'l'hc one means the country occupied hythe Saevi, the other
the country occupied hythe Franks. Baaara'a is another
such name, derived from the Boii. Saaoay isin a similar,
though sonrewhat different, predicament. They all, however,
agree in being names of oountries derived from their po
pulationa. Haase is, probably, tbe same, and Ttariayia

also.
