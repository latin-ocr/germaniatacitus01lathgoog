The evidence in favour 01110 former view, ir strong;
Tiberius-“ Sicambros dedentes se traduxit in Galliam atque
in proximis Rheno agris collocavit.''-Suet. Aug. 21.

Again,— “Germanico (bello) quadraginta millia dedititi-
orum trajeoit in Galliam, juxtaque ripam Rheni sedibus as-
signatis collocavit.''-ldem, Tib. 9.

Tiberine, speaking 01 himself, says, that, “ Se novisse divo
Augusto in Germaniam missum, plura consilio quam vi per-
fecisse; sic Sicambros in deditionem acceptos, sic Suevos.''-
Tac. Anu. ii. 26.

A strouger expression still occurs iu another place :-“ Ut
qnondam Sicambri excisi, 01 10 Gallias trajecti forent, ita
Silurum nomen penitus extinguendum.”-Ann. xii. 39.

00 the other hand,-

a. The name Sicortbri was probably (inflia, since we find
it in Oaesar. Possibly, it was acclusioely so; in which case,
the explanation is clear. It disappeared 00 soon as tho Ger·
mans, to which it applied, became known by their German
designatione.

b. It was, perhaps, the 0011001100 namo 010 0001010007,
consisting 01 mermi, Gambrioii, Marsi, and others; in
which 0000 11 became 01001010 when 110 confederacy was
broken up.

1 10 001 profess to see my way clearly here; or 10 10
0110 10 decide to even my own satisfaction. Neither can l ex-
plain the relation between the names Sicambri (Su-pambri)

110001100101.

Besides this, there ir a Gambcrc, conspicuous as a female
lauder, iu the Langobard traditione.

And, besides this, the Cimbri.

And, besides this, the root kmp =Jtybt,· so that karapfcr

The syllable si-‚ both Zeuss and Grimm 00001100 10 re-

Sicambri = Sip-ycmbri = strong sor victory = siey-ta·
