suae parochiae, ultimam scilicet partem Saxoniae, quae est trans
Albiam et dicitur Nordalbingia, continens tres populos, Tett-
· murcos, Ηοῐεατοε, Stomartos.”-Helmold. Chron. Slavor. i. 6.
“Attrita sunt vires Saxonum, et servierunt Orneoni sub tributo,
omnis terra videlicet Nordalbingorum, quae disterminatur in
tres populos: Hotzotoe, Sturntnrioe, Ttetmorohoe.”-—Id. i. 26.

This means the Germana ot Holstein, Stormar, and Dit-
marsh; but whether they were Scaena, strictly speaking,
is uncertain.

The precem population is Platt-Dentech; but the intro-
duction of this is subseqnent to the ninth century.

The population on which it eucrcached was North Frisium
and this, Ι believe, to have been what was called the Nordot·
hington Scaea—See note in v. Frate.

1 believe thieto be a German modification of the Tshekh
(Bohernian or Morauian) name of the Gothint' ‚· the Tetekt
modification having changed the eto J, and the German the
tto u. Besidea which, it replaced the inflectional element
-n- by the affix -ung; as was the case in the word Potab-
iop-ae= Slavoniana of the Elbe (Lato) ς where po- is Slavonic,
Lada, Slavonic, aad doy— German.

The form Vitungi oecura=Juthun9t Now these and
similar varieties* should remove all difficulties on the acore
ola word taking such different shapes aa Jutae, Juttmyi,
Geatae, Gothi, Gottioi, Gythome, Garum Gautae, Vite,
Vittunpi, Gelu since the following varieties of an equally
simple root are as numerous. The Bnlgarians appear aa
Bau, Bury, Borg, Buruy, Wuruq, Wurg, Vuty, notar, Byler,
Bitere, Biter, Beira. Similar instances could be multiplied;
but this is one where the languages through which the form
pasees are the saure, aa, Slavonic, German, Latin, and
Greek.

These varieties of form not only cause no difficulty,
but they supply a confirmation. The unsteadiness of power
in the case of the consonant G, is what is expected a priori,
