The people 01 Finlend call themselves Qecins. Most of
their neighbours call them Fines.

The Laplanders 0011 themselves Sedete (101000). The Nor· ἱ
wegians 0011 1100 Fines Fiemark means chmark.

The hill-tribes of India have ec collective neme at all.
Each tribe has its separate denomination. The collective
names Kleond, Bell, ser, 800, 000 all Hindu.

The Slavonians vary the name with the 001100. The
Germana they 0011 Neemcy, the Finne Tslnid.

TheGermans 0011011 Slavoniens Wends. No Slavonian ι
calls himself 00.

This list 01 110 (1111000000 between native end foreign
designatione might be greatly extended. The present in·
stances merely illustrate the extcnb to which the difference
occurs.

ln ancient writers wc are seldom sure of the name applied
10 a giren populetioa being notice. We should rather look
100 11 10 110 languagc 01 110 population that supplied the
information.

From which it follows that we can rarely assume that any·
name belongs to the language of the population to which
it applies; and thie 0000100 0 difficulty too often overlooked.

I never allow myself 10 assume this indigenous origin of e
national 0000, except under the following 0100000000οε-

1. When the information concerning 0 nationis known to
10 drawn from the nation itself at first-hand.-Thus, 011 1101
00000 writes concerning the Germane I attribute to Gallie
sources; end, consequently‚ assume the names to bc Gallio
also. They may be German as wcll; but this is an accident.
He may also iu certain exceptione} cases have taken the
German designation. The general rulo, however, is, that
the 0000 belongs 10 110 language 01 110 1010000010.

2. When the name has 0 meaning in the language to
which it applica—Thus, Marce-menni is so truly German
that, even 10 Caesar, I believe it to be native. How 01100 11
may be 0010 10 assume euch a meaning 10 another question.

3. When the nemeis one ont of two or urany.-Believ·
ing (as, with many better judges, I do) that the words
cate and desei arc different names 1001100000 people, and
