srom each other-one of which lies wholly to the worth, the
other, wholly to the south of the Danube. i

North of the Daavhe, reckoning from west to east, come—

A. l. The Tshehhs, or Bohemiene of Bohemia.

2. The Moravians, or the Tshekhs of Moravia, nearly
identioal with the Bohemiane-the two lenguagee being but
subdialects of the common Tshekh tongne.

3. The Sloveks ol Upper Hungnry, differing more from the
Bohemiane and Moraviane then those two natione do from
each other, bnt still belonging to the great Tshekh or Bo·
hemian division. The dialeots and snbdialeets of the Slovak
language are aa numerous ae the Slovak villages3 a fact from
which some inferences will he drawn in the sequel.

The Tshehh divisionis limited to Bohemia, Moravie‚ and
Upper Hungary. Both northwarde and eaetwards, the
character of the language changes. '

B. Silesia, even at the present moment, ie not wholly Ger-
man. Tho Serkie of Lower and the Srhie ol Upper Lueatia
are Slavonio. They do not, however, belong to the Tshehh
eo much as to the Lelrh, or Polish branch. Hence their
affinities are with their north-eastern rather than with their
south-western neighbours.

1,2. The Serke and Serbs are the most south-western
members now in existence ol the Lehh branch of the Slavonic
stock; a division which takes the l'orm of a separate substan-
tive nationality with-

3. The Peles of Pelorid, Posce, parts of Gallicia, parte of
Lithuania, and parts of Pomerania.

Ο. Ruseian. A modified form of the Brassica, called Rus-
niak, or Ruthenian—ooonre ae lar west ae Gallieia‚ where
itis in oontact with the Slovak of Upper Hungnry and the
Polish of Poland. Further to the north it is bounded by the
Lithnanian of Lithnania, Uourland, and Livonia, and by the
Eethonian of Esthonia-this laet being a Finnic language.
Vast ae is the area covered ⁸hy the Ruseian language, its
dialecte are remarkahly few3 a lact which should be con·
treated with the multiplicity of dialeots in the Slovak.

And here the north-Slavonic area ends; an area which
we may, if we chooee, call Troas-Danubium since all the
