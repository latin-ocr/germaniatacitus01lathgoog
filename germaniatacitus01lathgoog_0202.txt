uorns on suorron x1. 59

in the time of Tacitus, we know nothing: neither con wo speculata
ae to the nature of the events on which they were based.

That the periodo, however, found in tho text before us (like
the present word seven-niybt, secundi) which we suppose to have

boen designated by some compound ol tho word -niqtt, were shorter
than those ol the mmntr, is nearly certain.

Montio is so truly aword olGerman origin, tud so definitely
connected with moon, that we may sofely believe that the natural
periodos twenty-eight days was always recognised, and nlways called,
as at present. In other words, it is unlikely that the name for
onon should have been the compound, or combination, of tho root
n-pt in question.

soit lessio it likely thet the compound in question was applied
to a longer period than that of the mouth.

That the mouth then was divided into smaller periodo is the sair

inlerence from the present passage—and that the quarters of the ,

moon were the phenomena which determined their length, is also
likely.

Still the German equivalent to the Romen nundine, and the
Christian west, is a point which has still to be investigated.

'lhet such prominenco should be given to the reckoning by nepita,
il it merely meant that where a Roman said so many days a German
said so many nsylns, is unlikely. l'hsre wne, surely, some period ol
