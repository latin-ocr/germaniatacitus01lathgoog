In respect to its form, Marco-manni is one of the most
satisfactory words of antiquity.

It first appears in Gaesar's notice of the subjecte and
allies of Ariovistus. The fact of Gaesar's informante being
Ganls, and the greater part of his nomenclatore being Gallio,
is the only, difficulty that acconrpanies the notion of the
German being the language in which its meaning is to be
sought.

But this is only the shadow of a shade; ineamuch as the
undoubtedly German authorities, in which it afterwards
occurs, do away with all doubt as to the tongoe to which it
belongs.

Nevertbeless, why this should be German, when Caesar's
other names are Gallie, is not so easy to say.

Its formis full and perfect. There ara the two elemento
which make it a compound (aarum) and the copula
(-o-) which connects thern.

Mork=marol‚ and monn=man, so that Marcomanni

From this derivation l draw three points ol great im-

portance in the practice of ethnologieal criticism, points
which, so far as Ι am awara‚ have never been sufficiently
attended to; at any rate, they have novor been made the
basis ot' so much infarence aa they will be in the following
a es.

Marcomanni being numerous; as numerous as the number ¹
