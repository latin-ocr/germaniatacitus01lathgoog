In favour of a Slavonic affinity are :—

1. 'l'heir Slavonic character at the time they were first described
from personsl knowledge.

2. The absence ol any traces ol a previous Germanic population in
the area occupied by them.

ln other words, it is a certain fact that in the twelfth century
the Warnsvi were Slavonic, whilst the belief that the Varini ware
German, is a reasonable, but not unexceptionable, inference.

Probably, they were s icontier population.

⁶It'udoser.]-One of the tribes of the Gimbric (lhersoncse in
Ptolemy's list, is that of the Φουνδοίισιοι. Here Ptolemy is wrong and
Tacitus right. Eudoses is the same word as Φουνδούσιοι, miuus
the Φ and ν. Such is Zeuss’s view. To justify the first changes he
quotes the similar (supposed) mistake on the part os Ptolemy, in the
word ‹tupddewoa See note on scardona.

The second is defended—and that reasonably-hy the forms
Βουντοῦνιαι, Βρινξάνιαι, Κέντιον ὄρος, and Bmvoxcipur3 in all of

Ptolemy places after rte scema aad ou the riser Chalcaea (perd δὲ

Now the Φαροδ- of Φαροδεινοί, is, according to Zeuss, the Scard-

but unsatisfactory. By an elaborate series of combinations he derives
his own name from it. He assumes :-
