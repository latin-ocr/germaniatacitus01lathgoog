iv run oanurwr or ricinus

Without admitting this, Ι have nothing better to pro-
pose; though, at times, Ι have thought that the ri, ew,
or sp, might=ths su· in dassen, and the Sugambri:
Soutll Gambrians. ’

At other times, it hes loolred like the 8-9, in the name of
the river step· so that Sigomlra' = (lambrione of tle δίας.

However, as long as there are fair reasons for believing it to
be no German word at all, suoh guessworlr is gratuitous,

The orthography of the name is varied. Althongh the

i be short-
“ 'l'u carde gaudenter Sicnmlffi

Compositis venerantur armis,’'

the Greek form is Σουγάμθροι, with the diphthong, as in Stra-
bo; though Σύγαμὲροι in most MSS. of Ptolemy. The
best form, perhaps, is Sugambri.

The lueelity of the Sioamdrv' is that of the Franks ol tha
LowerRhine; the ,question as to whether the Frank history
be a continuation of the Sicambriau, or the history of
another population on the same ground, being involved in
the questions just notioed, niz. the extent to which the dis-
appearance of the name was nomiual or real; refereble to
the extinction of the nation‚ or referable to tha displaoement
of an ἱ0Ιᾶ term by a nawense, explaIned by the influence uf
an army, or explained by the influenee ol a synonym.

And this question stands open.

Along with this should be taken from the following chap-

pios et Tubantes concessit3 quorum terris exaoti oum Chattos,
dein Cheruscos petiissent, errore longo, hospites, egeni, hostes

praedam divisa est.''—-lbid. 56. ’
