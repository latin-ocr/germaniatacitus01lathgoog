changes as we proceed either northwards or southwards more than it
does in a direction from east to west, or from west to east, the con-
trast between the population of the head-wetere, and the population
of the embouchures of long rivers ia greater where the difference of
latitude is greatest, and least where itis least-other things, as said
before, being equal.

'l'he great vertical rivers of Northern Asia hare the conquering
Mongcl and 'Purks on their sources, the stunted Samaeids on the
mouths. '

The great vertical rivers of Southeru Asia bare 'l'ibetan moun-
tains, between the thirtieth and thirty-fifth degrees of north latitude,
and Siamese and (lambojians in latitudo teu.

The Nile hae Negroes in its extreme valleys, Abyssinians on its
tableland, aud AEgyptians on its great rallcy and Delta

The northernmort Mississippi Indians approach the type of the
Eskimo, the southernmost that of the Maxicans.

Most of the great rivers of the world are vertrad ,· tha chief hori-
zontal directions being those of the Amazon in America, the Sene-
gal in Africa, the Hoangho and Kiang-ku in Asia, and the Danube
in Europe.

The horizontal direction of the two great Ohiuese rivers undoubt-

edly does much towards determining the homogeneous character of
the (lhinese civiliaation. At the same time they help to account
forits isolation.

The direction then is one of difference between the Danube aa
boundary to Germania and the Rhine.

The course of the Danube determined the migration eastward,
those of the Rhine (and still more of the Weser and Elbe) north·

ward.

Another difference between the two rivers is the character of their
water-system. Contrasted with the Danube the Rhine has but few
foedere ; indeed it bas but few feeders compared with any river of
equal magnitude, unless it be the Rio Grande of 'lexas 'Phe Rhine
is supponed ae the resercoir of the Lake of constance rather than
supplied by its tributaries. From this it follows that the basin or
rehey-system of the Rhine is preeminently small ς so that its allu-
rial plains siuls into insignificance when compared with those of the
Danube, or even the Elbe, Oder, and Vistula. Whatever we subtract
from the area of the valleys of a river, brings the hill-tanges in
closer approximation to the stream, in which we have a mountain·
