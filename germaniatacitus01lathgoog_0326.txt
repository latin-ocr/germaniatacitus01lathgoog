Nrraunn has expressed an opinion, that the Gainounia was
written during the youth of Tacitus.

Whatever other reasons there may be for holding this view,
there is the following,-

A writer in amonograph is generally fuller of details than
he is ina general work. Now in the Annulo aud History,

there are several German tribes mentioned, of which no notice
is taken in the Germania, and this omission is explained by
the notion, that Tacitus's knowledge increased between the
composition ol the different morke. Strange as it ia, that
he should not have known the Sicambri, Ampsivarii, tre,
when the (lemonia was written, it is stranger still, that he
should have known and not enumerated thern.

Hence, the Annals and History are, to a certain extent,
the complement to the Germania, and similarly to compare
small things with great, the present Epilepomena form the
complement to the Notos.

Of the populations mentioned in the Annals and History,
but not mentioned in the Germania, the following is the list.

1. Tb Sicambri—First mentioued by Oeesar on the Lower
Rhine (see extracta p. lxxix.), the Sicambri take considerable
prominence and importance in the reign of Augustus. Beiug
conquered by Drusus, they appear mors thau once in the
poetry of both Ovid and Horace, as formidable enemies now
humbled. Indead, few names were more associated with the
ideas of murderous ferocity and savage brarery than that of

the obanter.
