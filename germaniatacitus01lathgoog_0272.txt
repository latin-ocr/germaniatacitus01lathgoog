Ita qui olim “ boni aeqnique Cherusci‚'’ nuno “inertes
ao stulti ” vocantur: Chattis victoribus fortuna in sa-
pientiam cessit. Tracti ruinh Cheruscorum et Fosi,i
contermina gens, adversarum rernm ex aeqno socii,
ciam in secundis minores fuissent.

Now on SBCHON xxxvl.

¹ oseaeJ-nhe first great fact in the history of the Cherusci is,
that they vvere the consedentes of Arminius, and the conquerors os
Varus. '

nne next is that they withstood the aggressione of their own
countrymen aa steadily as they did those oi Rome.

'Phe Cherusci are mentioned hy Caesar, and mentioned aa the
hereditary enemies of the Suevi The Cherusci, too, it uas who
first checked the conquesta and consolidatione of Maroboduus.

We may look upon the Cherusci* as the heads of a great conseder-
ation, not only on the strength of their history, but on the evidence
ef ancient writers, ey, Strabo, oi Χηροῦσκοι rol oi τούτων ὑπήκοοι
-Taoitua ‘¹ Cherusci, meimet eoram.'’

If so, the impert of the name may fluctuate, and sometimes mean
a particular people, sometimes serve aa a collective designation, in·
cluding several such emeher divisione. This assumption easea many
difficulties—perhaps, indeed, it ia absolutely necemcry. We hear sc
contiuually of gran natione, like the Chatti, Cherusci, Sigambri and
others, being conterminous, that, ifvve take the texte wherein such
notices occur literally‚ sve leave no room ior several minor natione or
tribes.

Thus, in the present instance, there are special statements which
bring the Cherusci-

α As iar south as the Chatti.

h. As far north as the Chauci.

c. As far vest as the Sicambri.

What room does this leave for snoh populations es the Chamavi,
Angrivarii, Fosi, eet Little, if any; especially if vve bring in

ὓ The lull import oi the Cheruscen resistcnce to Rome, the valne of the
patriotism oi Arminius, and the extent to which the Cheruscas glory is as
much English as German, are well developed in Professor Creasy's ‘⁴ The
Fiitceu Decisive Bettles oi the World,’' ioremost emcngst which ho places
the deleat oi the legions oi Varias.
