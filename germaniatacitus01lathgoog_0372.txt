The reasons for the existence of a Lithuanic population in
scandinavia, lie chiefly in the facts which it will account
for. But this requires us to be sure that there is no other
alternative.

If the existence of a Germanic population will not account
for the presence of the form Ga (with ita varieties) in Scan·
dinavia, what population wille

The only two that present themselves for consideration,
are the Fine, and the Lithuanio.

The fact of the root in question being krrown ιο be Lithu-
anic‚ and not known ιο be Pinnio, is primii socie in favour
of the former.

The Lithuanian is the only known family of which it ’
can be said that G·t, as the name of one of its members‚
in the mouth ol a German would be likeliest of all known
names.

The only word that can be set up against it Eastc=AEstii‚
thet being the only kcsown German name applied ιο a
Lithuanian nation.

But as Eosta=eostcrn it could apply to eastern localities
only; not ιο any in Scandinavia.

This leaves (Η as the only known name applicable.

Reasons for its being the one actually applied, are,—

c. It was, besides being the native, the diaconio name as
well.

ι. Ιι was from the Slavonians that the Scandinavian
Germane were likely ιο take the name of a population, between
whom and themselves the Slavonians lay intermediate.

c. Lastly‚ to certain of the Lithuanians on the south of the
Balce, a compound of the root in question actually was ap
plied - East from Poland is Reid-pota·land-“ En costr frr‘a
Polena er Reid-petoland.”- Fragment from the Fornaldar
Sdgur. (Zeuss, p. 500).

The Lithuaniens then, eccll ol the Baltic, are called by
the ancestors of the present Dones, Swedes, and Norwegiens‚
(ι’-ι. Surely, the same name, applied by thc same people on
the nortl ol the Baltic, is likely to have been applied to
Lithuanians also.

111. What applies to the Gotho of Gothland applies also
