If so, the population to whom it applied, must have called
themselves by an adp'mtical appellatiour and thie is no more
thau the present Danas and Swedcs do‚-Dan-ske, Sven-slre.

if so, the -‹i- ie omitted; end this is uo more than what
occurs in the form Nor-ska, from Nor-d-ske,-the fuller form
being Harcdche, or Clcredskc.

ln Beowulf end the Traveller's Song, we lind mention
of a town with a palacc in it, called Hcerci.

Near this Haeret, the Haeocardas were deleatedr a
population et no great distance from the Augles—probably
either the Barda of cardoneto, or the Langobardi of Tacitus.

Except that the Hertz is a mountain-range rather than a
town, Heorct=Harta, of which it ie the Low German sorm.

l also think it was the country of the Harudes. Also, of
the Proper Cherusci-though, 1 admit, that it carries them
aslar east asit is saleto do.

Hence, I consider that the Heredes were the Cherusci
in the most limited sense of the term, and the Oti Saxeus
the Cherusci in the widest; the one name being that by
which they were known to their matera, the other that by
which they were known to their emtam neighbours3 and,
· although their political extinction is doubtful, their diminiehed
importauee (noticed by Tacitus) mey hare favoured the sub—
stitutiou of one name lor another.

The following linee justify usin placing the Cherusci eo far
eastward as hasbeen done:

Venit accola silve
Bructerus Hercyniae, latisque paludibus exit
Cimber et ingentes Albim liquere Cherusci.
Accipit ille preces variae, tardeque rogatus

Annrrit et magno pacem pru munere donat.
Claud. De ir. Cone. Houor. 450.

The Cherusci were part of the Eastphaliaus (Oatplrab') of
not. in v. Angrivarii.
But Ptolemy places the Haeredes in the Cimbric Cher-

sonese, and ao (perhaps) does Beowull'. This is a grave
objection to the previous doctrine.
