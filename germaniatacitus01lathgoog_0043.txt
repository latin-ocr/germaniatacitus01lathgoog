that the circumstance of certain Greek towns of Southern
Italy, calling their slaves Pelasgi, indicates a previous Pelasgic
population. By a not illegitimate extension of this view,
the existence of the system of costes is supposed to betohen a
duality of raca-the conquered and the conquerors. But a
servile class of conquersd aborigines, was as much wanting in
the Slavonian porticus of the Gerrunio, when it was first
known otherwise thau by hearssy, as the analogues of the
Wclsh or Biscayans. The signs ofa primitive population‚
shown as they show themselves in Britain or Spain: shown
as they showed themselves in Graece or Italy; or shown as
they showed themselves in Hindostan, were equally non-
existent.

Neither were there any traditiose. No lays celebrated
either the Arthur which defended, or the Ida which ravaged
the soil. The supposed conquerors knew of no indigeam
which they replaced. No iodiyeaae complained of the-
stranger who dispossessed them.

Lastly‚ Socors as is England‚ tho oldest geographical terms
are Kcltt'o‚· some of the original names of the rivers and

· ·mouutains remaining unohanged. The converse is the case

in Transalbingian Germany. The older the name the more
surely is it Slavonic.

So much for the extent of the assumed displacement. It
must have been the greatest and the most absolute of any
recorded in history.

It must also have taken place with unparalleled rapidity.
By supposing that the assumed changes set in immediately
after the time of Tacitus, and that as soon as that writer had
recorded the fact that Potane, Bohemia, and Oourland were
parts of Gomoario, the transformation of these previously
Teutonis areas into Slavonic ones, began, we have a con·
dition as favourable for a great amount of changes as can
fairly be demanded. Still it may be improved. The last
traces of the older population may be supposed to have died
out only just before the time when the different areas became
known as exclusively Slavonic; an assumption which allows
the advocate of the German theory to say that, had our in·
formation been a little earlier, we should have found what we
