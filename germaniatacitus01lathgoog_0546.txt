similar silence of the Keltic ones, since the Gothic legende are
the most numerous, and the most ancient. Resides this, they
deal very especially with genealogies, national and individual.
The name of Bojcrix, a Gimbrie king mentioned in Epitome
Liviana (lxvii), is Keltic rather than Gothic, although in the
latter dialecto proper names ending in -ric (Alaric, Gccscric)
frequently occur.

Measnring the evidence, which isin its character essen-
tially cumulative, consisting of a number cf details unimport-
autin themselves, but of value when taken in the mass, the
balance seems to be in favour of the Cimbri, Teutonas and
Ambrones being Gauls rather than Germana, Kelts rather
than Goths.

An argument now forthcoming stands alone, inasmucb as it
seems ιο prove two things at oceania, not only the Keltic
origin of the cimbri, but, at the same time, their loeality in
the Chersonese. It is brought forward by Dr. Pritchard, in
his Physical History cf Mankind, and runs as follows:-
(c.) lt is a statement of Pliny that the aea in their neighbour-
hood was called hy the Gimhri Morinorum, cr the deod scc=
marc incanum. (h.) lt is a fact, that in Keltic Welsh mor
morrotl=mcro mortuum, morimumsa, deod seu. Hence the
langnage of the Gimbric coast is ιο be considered as Keltic.
Now the following facts invalidate this conclusion z—(l.)
Putting aeide the contradictione in Pliny's statement, the
epithet dead is inapplicable to either the German Ocean or
the Baltic. (2.) Pliny's authority was a writer named Phile·
mon: out cf the numerous Philemone enumerated by
Fabricius, it ir likely that the one here adduced was a eon·
temporary of Alexander the Great; aud it is not probahle
that at that time glossas from the Baltic were lrnown in the
Mediterranean. (3.) The subject upon which this Philemon
wrote was the Homeric Poems. This, taken along with the
geograpby of the time, makes it highly probahle that the
original Greek was not Κίμὲροι, bnt Κιμμέριοι; indeed we

are not absolutely sure of Pliny having written Cimbri. (ι.)
As applied tc Cimmerian sea the epithet dead was applicable.
(5.) The term Morimurrwo=marc mortwrwa although good
Keltic, is better Slavonic, since throughout that stoclr of lan·
