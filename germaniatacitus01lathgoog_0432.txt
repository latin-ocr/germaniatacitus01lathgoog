’ pla-Agath. Hist. i. 6.

Notwithstanding this, l think it is an open question,
'whether the name may not have been applied by the truer and
more unequivocal Germane of Suebis and Franconia, to certain
less definitely Germanic allies from Wurtemburg and Badeo,
—parts of the Decumates agri,—parts which might have
supplied a Gallie, a Gallo-Roman, or even a Slavonic clement
to tho confederacy; in which case, a name so Gemma as to
have given the present Freuch and Italian name for Gmnmny,
Ι may, originally, have applied to a population other than
Germanic.

lknow the apparently paradoxical elementa in thie view;
but Ι also know that, in tho way of etymology, it ie quite
as ease to translate ull by alii, as by omnes: and l cannot
help thinking that the al in Ale-manni is the al in aliu-arto
(ο soree'yner, or man of another sort), eli-benzo (uu uben), and
aliland (captiuity ia forcipe hnd)—Grimm, ii. eas-Recht-
salterth, p. 359. And still more satished am I that the At,
in Alemanni is the ol· in Alsatia=cl-sass=oli-satz=soreiyn
settlement. In other words, the prefix in question is more '
probably the ol· in el-se, than the al· in all.

Little, however, of importancc turns on this.

The locality of the Alemanni was tho parts about the
Limes Romanus, a houndary which, in the time of Alexander
Severus, Niebuhr thinks that they first brohc through. Hence
they were the Marchmen of the frontier, whoever those
Marchmen were.

Other such Marchmen were the Sucui,· unless, indeed, we
consider the two names as synonyma. Zeuss admits that,
between the Suevi cl Suabia, and the Alemanni, no tangible
difference can ba lound.

The area whence we bring these Alemanni, or Suevi of
Suabia, must fullil certain conditione.

lt must not be too limited; since it is the area from which
not only the agri Decumates were Germanized in the first
instance, but from which, eventually and indirectly, Switner·
laud and Austria have been, partially‚ Bavaria, wholly, Ger-
manized.
