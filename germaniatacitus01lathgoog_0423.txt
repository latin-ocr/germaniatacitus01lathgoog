Assume, however, a change, and you have an additional
complication3 since you have ιο account for its transferas
well.

The present existence, then, ol the term Gaddm= Go-
thore-is an argument, ae far as it goes, against any change
of the original population; or, changing the expression, the
supposed immigration of Lithuanians, and displacement of
Germane, which hae been shown to be improbable in iteelf,
ie rendered more eo by the details that must be assumed if
we suppose that the Guddoo took their name from any Gar-
tcccs who were German.

ln order ιο melre the Gothiae· ee Lithuanic ae the Gerana,
we must suppose one ol two things, either that the former
were an outlying isolated section of the Lithuanic stock, or
that the intervening arcae between the Gothiui and Go-
thonee were Lithuanic. Are there any reasons against the
latter view-reasons against assuming the continuity of a
Lithuanic population from the Carpathiane ιο the Baltic
(and eice osred), from the mere magnitude of the areat None.
The Lygian, which was parallel with it, is, iu the same .
direction (from south to north), fully or nearly ae large.

From the present distributiones the Lithuanian dialecte,
there are several ς but that these are not insuperable‚ is shown
in the Prolepomeao.

1 do not, however, prees the point, since the approach of
the Gothini to the servile condition indicates the possibility
of their having been an outlying colony of captives.

All that I urge is the reference of the two (Gothini and
Gethones) to a common ethnolcgical division (that division
being the Lithuanic), aud the hypothesis which accounts for
the similarity of names.

I eleo urge the necessity of bringing the older Lithuanians
ae far south as the parte just north of Gallicia, even if we
hesitate to continue them up to the very country of the
Gethonee.

For clear and definite history-and we must rememher
that history lor these parts begins but little before the twellth
