traced higher than the reign of Geracalla3 and (a fact of
primary importanoe) they were theu io ro country of tle
Getae. So they were when Decius and Claudius fought
against them; so they were when, pressed by the Hune,
they besought Valens to allow them to pass the Danube; so
they were when Hermonric's kingdom was consolidated,
and so they were until they invaded Macedonia, Illyri-
cum, Greece, Italy, Southern Gaul, Franco and Spain. Of
all the Gothic families their migratione were tho most oonsi-
derable.

It was a long oue that took them from Germany to the
country ol the Getae. It was a longer one which carried
them from the country of the Gctae to Spain.

0f all the Gothic tribes the Gotho Proper have most
merged their nationality in that of the countries which they
invaded. ln Greece, in Italy, in Southem Gaul, and in
Spain, no Goths are to be found as a separate substantive
people; and no known dialect definitely and uuequivocally
represents the old Moeso-Gothic. On the Lower Danube
itself, the Gotho of the Grimea, now uo longer distinguished
by their German tongue, eud, consequently, no longer easily
distinguishable from their neighbours, are their sole represen-
tatives —if such they can now be called. In Germany itself‚
the mother-country, from which even at the beginning of their
history they were already separated, the Thuringian dialect is
supposed to be the most Gothio; but this—a statement made
by Michaelis-has yet to be definitely confirmed.

But the history of the Ostro-Goths and Visi-Goths, is no
history of all the populations whose name was Gt, thl,
or some similar form. Hence arises the long series ol ques-
tions as to whether each population, thus connected in name,
were connected in other attributes also; ia, whether they
were really Goths, or only populations with a nominal resem-
blance. ’

Ι. Is there any connection between the Gotllonee and Ge
clini? Three points connect them.

l. The similarity of names-Gellioi as compared with
Gethone.

2. The fact that they each differ from the Slavonians of
