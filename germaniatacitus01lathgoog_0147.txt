some notable points of contrast. Deest-sads ss a name taruennam,
in the sense in which it occurs in the nina century, was an impos-
sibility in the first, or mmcd. This is not sufficiently considered.
Many believe that the Teut, in aeaeae, is the dem, in ᾱιιιι-κΙι
Το be this exaetIy is impossible. Any German tribe that called
itself peuda, Diot, or Dsob in the first century must have given a
different meaning ιο the word ; and, so doing, have called theus-
selves tremisses, beroea or by some term equally complimentary 5—
certainly not by any word meaning speakers os the csdpcr misyae.

This is to prepare the reader sor some harther criticism, which
will occur in thesequel.

Allemagne and Lamagna are merely moderniaed forms of the
name of a particular sectiones the Germane, the Alcameni.

The English name, as already stated, is a translation oi the
Roman one.

Gaurani, then, isa name given by the Romans to the populations
who afterwards called themselves Damae, and Gernsoaic is tha
Roman eqnivalent to Deutschland; whilst emmo and Gmaaay are
English sonus oi the Roman designation.

It by no means, however, follows, that because the Romans called
a certain people by a certain name, that that name was Rama,-
although reasons have been given* for considering that it is the
Latin word permeat.

1 believe, lor my own part, that the word was Keltio; in other
words, that whilst the Germans themselves had no collective name
at all, the Romans called them what they were called by the Gauls
The meaning of this Gallio designation is a matter ol legit-imate
speculation. At present, it is sufficient to fix the languaga in which
the etymology is ιο be sought.

The date ol the first mention of the name German is more curicus
than important. A distinction, however, connected with tha inres-
tigation of it is necessary.

The earliest date assigned to an event in German history is one
thing ς the earliest historiari who mentions such an event ia another.
Α very early event may be recorded by a very late historiari.

'Phe word renides-mosaic was applied to the natione who, as early
as the second Carthaginian war, came across Hannibal in his passage

of the Alps. But, early as this is for the fact itself, the historisn
who recorda it is late—Livy.
