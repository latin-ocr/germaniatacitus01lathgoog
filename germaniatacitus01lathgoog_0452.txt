Tha only doubt is about its being ecolosinaly Keltic, ia,
not German.

The reason in favour of this view are, perhaps, all referable
to one head, oia, the facts which the hypothesis will account
for. Of these the chief are-

l. The pectoralia! of tho term, as seen by the express
evidence of Tacitus himself.

2. The equally express evidence of Tacitus to the fact of
a general or common name sor the Gemens being roceam
and of that name being Germani—not Suom.

3. The difficulty of making it apply to any grem dietam
of the Germanic stoek. For such, we have already, in the
names Inpaeoonee, Ietceoonea and Herminones, more than we
can easily deal with.

4. The non-mentionof the name abaci iu Gaesar, combined
the high probability of some, at least, of Oresar's Saevi having
belonged to that branch.

5. The act of Tacitus, vvho places the atara in Gasar's
locality of the Saevi, placing the Saevi to the east of it.

6. The difficulty of accounting for this by means of a
migration. Though Ooesar has no mention of the chatti,
and Tacitus hus, it is not Tacitus vvho first notices them.
The name appears in Strabo. Hence, if there nere a real
bodily change of locality on the part of the Suevi, thus ·
supposed to have beau driven eaetwards by the Chatti, the
displacement must have occurred between the time of (iasar
and Strabo, ia, between the time of Julius and Augustus
(iasar—and that without either the Romans of Gaul or the
Germane noticiog it.

Horreum, what a migration will aot explain, the assump-
tion of the word Saevi being a synonym to some os the
previous names oili. Saevi may mean Claro. Saevi may
mean Hermunduri, or it may (as I believe it does) partiolly
coincide with toti.

But what explains the synonymi Nothing better than the
existence of a second language‚ especially when that second
language is oo fiction, but a reality.

What lies against thisl Iwill put the only strong argu·
ment on this side of the question in its strongest form. From
