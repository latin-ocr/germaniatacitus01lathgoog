es well as theodotii, and in modern geography, there is ο Suebis as
well as a Hessc.

l believe that the difficulty is diminished 1)] the ξ on theSueui in
the Epileyomeno.

Το the question, why did (leessr call the (letti Suevil the
auswers are of two kinds.

1. It may be said that the nsme had changed in the interva13
either by the preponderancs of u different branch of the confedera-
tion. or by some other means.

2. lt may be said that the two names belonged to different
languoges, and that Sueu- was the name by which the Chatti were
known to Oaeser's informante, the Gauls 3 just ss the Kprwry are

ι known to the English by the name of Welsh.

The letter view is the one adopted by the present writer.
'Phet Sueoi was the Gallio name of the Germane of the hliddle
Rhino, l feel certain. Whether it was exclusively Gallio, ie,
foreign to these same Germans themselves, will be considered in
the ξ just referred to.

If ιο, the portiones the range to which it applied would be the

would suggest the contrary notion. As it is, however, we must
suppose that the term reached Aristotle orbis informante just as
the words Alp, Keil, or (daed (Fu'hurue) did.

'Phe Hercynian forest, as delineated by cesar, only partially
follows the line of the Danube. There is, however, a tract in physi-
cal geography with which it coincides entirely. This is the system
of highlands or mountains, which forms the northern boundary
of the valley of the Danube. Hence, from west to east, the line
of the southern limit of the tract in question runs from Baden
(Rauraci), where the river-system is that of the Rhine, along the
highlands of Wurtemburg (Decumates apra), franconis, Bohemia,
Mornvia, and Upper Hungery. Here the bend to the left (north)
takes place 3 in other words, we have the long flat valley of the
Theiss (Tibiscus) intervening between the mountain-range and the
