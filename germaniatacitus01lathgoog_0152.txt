ιο call them so. There is no conclusive answer to this objection.

Itis not, however, one which the carelul reader of Cesar, unbiassed
by German predilectiona, is likely tc take. How clearly does ιι

recognise the Germanic elementa of the character of the Nervii and
others, and how careful ιι is to n‘otify them l

Surely, it is not too much tc say that in Oaescr's time the Pennine
population was wholly Gallio, and not half-German.

N ow if we ιο this, Livy's credit must be saved by either supposing
that he used the word omme with a considerable degree of latitude,
or else that his statement appliee to ιιι time he wrote about rather
than his own.

Ι believe the former to have been the case, and answer the ques-
tion raised in the beginning ol the present note, by asserting my
belief thetae the Tylccpia', dre, were noa-Germanic, there were no
Germane, aa integral elementa ol the population of Gallia, either
when Tacitus wrote or when Hannibal marched across the Alps.

*Ehwald-The oonntriee south of the Danube were first subdued
under Augustus ‚· when they were formed into the following pro-
vinces l. Rhaetia 2.Vindelicia 3. N oricum 4. Pannonia Superior.
5. Pannonia Inferior.

Rhatia, the modern Tyrol, was bounded by Helvetia on the west,
by Vindelicis οι ιιι north, and by Noricum on the east. From
Noricum it was dirided by the River Inn (AElnus).

Vindelicia coincides with the southern hall ol Bavaria, or that

portiones Bavaria which lies south of the Danube, and part ol
Wurtemburg. It was bounded on the north-west by the Decumates

Agri=Baden‚ and part ol Wurtemberg.

Noricum, the modern salzburg, and Upper dustria, extended
from the Inn (AEnus) to the Kahlenherg (Mona (letius).

The Pannonias were bounded hythe Kahlenberg, the Danube,
and the Save, and coincide with the south-western part of Hungary,
and lower Austris.

Now of these four names for five provinces, Tacitus mentions only
two‚-Rheetia and Pannonia. Of Vindelicis and Noricum he says

nothing—although each reached ιο ιιι Danube ; which Rhatia,
in the strict sense of the word, did not.

Vindelicia, then, he evidently includes in the area of the Rhoeti.
What, however, he considered Noricum ιο ιι, is doubtful. Did he
count it as part of Pannonia on the east, or as part of Rhoetia on the
