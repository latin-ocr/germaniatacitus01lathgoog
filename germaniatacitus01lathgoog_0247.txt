Beden, three-fourths of Wurtemburg Hohenncllern, and a small

corner οἰ Bavaria.
Physically, they form the diariot oi the Black lloreet and the

Rauhe Alpe, and consist of a table-land, containing the head-vetars
ol the Nechar.

⁴ Limite cclo.]—-Wns thia limes a ditch, vall, or rampart, or vas
it a physical boundary; in other vverde, does limes mean an artificial
or a natural line of demerentionl The reference ιο Frontinus in
the previous note partially answars this. 'l’he limes vas an artifioicl
boundary.

Between the bend of the Neohar and the upper part of the river
Altmuhl, in the neighbourhood of Ohringen‚ are the remains os a
fortified ditch. On the Upper Altmuhl they can be traced afresh;
and they re-appear on the Danube, between Pioring and Kelheim.

Part or the vhcle of this ie called the Proselemauer, or Deoil'e Wcll.

The inference that it is οἰ Roman origin is unexoeptioneble. The
exact line, however, has not‚l believe, been uorhed out. Neither
has its connection or noc-connection vvith the Psnlrl·0rcben.

'lhe PsahLGrabm is a similar line, running at nearly right angles
nith the river Iahn, between Giessen and Ortenburg.

For practical purposee, a rough conventionel line will do as vell
asareel one. This may be drawn so aa ιο make the limen run from
the hlaine to Kelheim‚ ie, from the junction of the Maine and Rhine,
ιο the junction nithe Altmuhl and Danube. Thia gives to the
Romam rather more thau Zeuss, and rather lesa than Niebuhr allevve
them.
