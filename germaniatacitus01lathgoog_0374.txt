But, besides this negative character of being aowSlavonic
(and therefore called (ι’-ι), the two populatione in question
may have been really connected.

A reason in favour of this (as far as it goes) ie found
in the fact of the Slavonians differing from the Germane
in the following particulare 2-

The Germane called all ooo-Germane by one name-
Weol.

The Slavonians varied the name with the different οοο-
Slavonio populations with which they came in contact.

Thus-they call the Finns Tetrici, and the Germane
Niemcy‚· and this ie a reason for thinking that they called
none Gt, but the Lithuaniane.

Further reaeoning on the subject occure in Epilepomeaa,
§ Pla relatione of aa Gotoe to India.

No objections lie against the Getae and Gotdooes being
equally Lithuanic‚ from the mere magnitude of the arca
If Slavoniane could extend from Servia to Poland‚ Lithu·
aniane might from Bulgaria ιο Pruesia.

The objections that arise from the present limited area
of the Lithuanian tongue are but slight. The limite of that
tongue bave ever receded.

Laetly, it should be remembered that whatever facte
brought the Gothonee nearer to the sortist, brought them
nearcr to the Geta also.

Such lethe hypothesie; which, whether convincing or the
contrary, is submittcd to scholare with a claim to their
carelirl consideration. lt explains the forms Gott, Geta,
Goth-land, Jot-land, Goth-inne, and Gotho, without assuming
any migratioo dy duod at all; only two dy water (one of
which is down a navigable river, and the other across'a sea
of moderate breadth); any displacemsnt sc great ae that
which is known to have occurred over part of the same
area within the historical period, and any power given ιο
any term more general than that which connects the names
wana as applied ιο a Gambro-Briton, and Welst as applied
to an Italian.
