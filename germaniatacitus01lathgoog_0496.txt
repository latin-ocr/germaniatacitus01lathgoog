Leipsio, were by no means Saxona as the people of Sussex
were. They were not even Saxone as the speakers of the
langnage of the Heliand, the Old Saxons, were. They were
either Platt-Deutsoh, or High-German Germane, most pro-

bably a mixture of both. Yet they were called Saxona,
because they conquered the Soaoay of the nineteeuth century,
from a country which was called Soaoay in the seventh and
eighth, but which, probably, was not so called in the fourth
and fifth, and which, certainly, was not so called in the
second and third.

7. Procopius mentions only three populations in Britain-
Angles, Frisians, and Britons.

8. The king who is said to have determiued that England
should be called the duplaland, was a king of the West·
Saxone, Eobert.

I consider thisa difficulty on one side fully equivalent to all
on the other. It is as if the hing of Praesia should proposo
that all Germany should call itself Austris.

1 think, upon the whole, that Socors was a word like Greek,
l.o.,a term which, in the language of the Hellenas, was ao very
special, partial‚ and nnimportant, as to have been practically
a foreign term, or, at least, anything but a native name;
whilst in that of the Romam, it was one ol general and
widely-extended import. Hence, mutatio mutandis, it is the
insignifioant Saaoooa of the neck of the Gimbric Chersonese,
and the three Saxon islanda, first mentioned by Ptolemy, who
are the analogues of the equally unimportant Graeol of Epirus:
and these it was whose name eventually comprised popula-
tions as different as the Angles, and the Saxone of Saxony,
even as the name Graan in the mouth of a Roman comprised
Dorieon, AEolians, Macedonicus, Atheniens, Rhodians, hc.

In this way the narne was Gomon, but its extended im-
port was Kolta'c and Roman. With this view, there ia as
little need to consider the Saxona of the neck of the Gimbric
Chersonese to have been aocctly what the Araplos were, as there
is for considering the Graeci ol Greece to have been exaotly
what the Athenianswere. They might eaeilyhave belonged
to another section of the Gothic population.

Such was, probably, the case. If not, tho continuity
