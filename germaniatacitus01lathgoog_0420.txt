words, Ι believe the name to be calice in one of the two cases
only; so that the Goth-ini were Gt only in the eyes of
their Slsvonic neighbours,j t asa Peloponnesian was a Greek
in the eyes of aRomau only; whereas the Gotloncs (Gesonae,
ko.) were Gt in the eyes of their Slsvonio neighbours and
themselves as well, even as the l’gocixoc of Epirus was donbly
Greek; Greek when ho spoke of himself, and Greek when
he was spoken of hya Roman.

c. There is uo evidence ol the numerous Lithusnic popula·
tione ever having had s collective or general name of their
own, however much they msy have hed one given them by their
Slavonic neighbours; in both ol these respects being exaotly
in the sameosseasthe Geraneae.

b. For the specific name of a particular Lithusnian popula-
tion (ie, for a name equivalent to Claui, Charmei, of similar
divisions of the Gemnani), the term Gothones (Gothini, Gut-
tones, tec), if extended from Gallicis to Gourland, is of im·
probable (Ι do not say impossible), extent. No single arction
of a population is likely to have had so large en area.

c. The differencc between the name of the people (Gothini),
and their language (Gallico), suggests the likelihood of the
notice of tha Gothini having been some form of Gal
(Hal, buc). In Eugland, in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centones, the generality ol writers spoke of the people of
Germany ss Gemoas3 but ol the louguuyc, as Dulcl, High
Dutcl, or Low Dutcl, as the csso might be. Hence, we heard
of translations from tle Hingntcl, even though the people
who spoke it were called Germans.

Now l consider that the same Slavonians who spoke of
the people of Gallicis as Gothini (a presumcd Slsvouic form),
were also those who spoke ol their language as Gallio (a pre·

sumed native form); even us oue and the sams population (the
English) spoke of the Dutcl tongne and the German people.
And l also consider that those same Slavonians called the
language of the Gothini Gallio, because Gallio was tho
notice name of it; just as the fact of Dntcl being the native

name of the German, accounts for the terme High Dutch sud
Low Dutch.
