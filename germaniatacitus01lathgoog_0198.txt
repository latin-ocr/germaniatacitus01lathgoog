should be other than German, is considered utterly improbable by
the great writer from whom I have tehen all the quotations aud
references of the present note.

That she was Sloconic is the opinion of the present inquiror.
But the most important fect connected with her edens, is that of its
being, at one aud the same time-

c soevo, as we leern from the textos Tacitus, und—

t. Vindrliciao, as we infer from her temple et Augsburg.

⁶Ooltiberc parietibus deos.]-'Phis absence of temples is partly
borne out by what we find in later writers, partly subjeeted to modi-
fication.

A. It is partly borne out by the fect of no German tongue contain-
ing asimple term equivalent ιο the Latin templum (delubrum, cedes),
of which both the sipoiyication end the native eripite are beyond
doubt.

1. Iu Ulfilas, ἱερόν (Joh. xviii. 20) is translated by (iud-ltus:
God's herme. This word, however, occurs but once, and is a com·
pound.

2. l'he usual word=rudc is allis.

The reasons for believfng this word ιο be native (the view sup
ported by the authority of Grimm) are es follows :-··

c. l'he genitive case is alba, and the detive elle, instead of adicis
and uldai; irregularity (so-called) being primii socie evidence of the
word in which it occurs being native.

b. In Aegle-Saron and Old Saxon, the word is of the masculine
ΕΘΙΣιθῐτι may be the word Alces of ξ 43.

d. lt occurs as an element of several compound proper names,

both of men aud places-A mholf, Ale-dorp, bc.

Against it lie

c. Its likeness to the Latin word ouh.

b. Its being, in Moeso-Gothic, of the feminine gender.

c. Iis absence in all the Neres languages.

d. Its power of pulcer or νομαὶ duellioy, a meening quite es
usual es that of hely edifice.

It is safe then to say that the native origin of otle=temptum is
not beyond doubt.

3. Vp is the third root with a meaning allied to thet of templum,
enumeratsd in the chapter of the D.- M. referred to.
