Lithuanic must be explained by either a migratiou, or an
original coutinuity of area.

The presumptious heve been determiued. Let ns now
choose between these alternatives.

The ludoEuropean populatiou may have been continued
from Asia into Europe (or cicc υονεᾶ) by two lines-

l. One to the nortl-

2. One to the south of the anpian Sea.

The difficulties, each way, are the same iu amount, though
different in kind.

l. 011 the north we have the vast tracte of ludepeudeut
Tartary, the water-systema of the Lower Jaik and Volgo,
iu which the Indo-European populatiou which, by assump-
tion, was continuone from the Oxus to the Duieper, has
wholly disappeared. Now the more we go back the wider
this interval becomes; since, the Russians, at the beginning
of the historieal period were further from India than they· are
now. The supposed displacemeut, theu, iu this quarter must
have been enormous. The further objections that arise out of
the distribution of the existing Turk aud Ugriau families of
the area in question (a distribution which makes it almost
impossible for an IudoEuropeau population ever to have
been on the uorth of the Caspian), are too numerous for a
work like the present.

2. A prolongation of the ludo-European area in the
directiou of Asia, aud to the south of the Caspian, is, at the
first view, practicable enough. And here the remark that
whatever brings Litloom'a nenrer to India dimioislca dr'ffi- ,
cultius, has its bearing. Let the Getae be Lithuauians, the
Thraeiaus may be Lithuanic also, siuee more than one good
authority of antiquity identifies the two. Then the Bithy·
niaue were Thraciam—which brings the European Lithuauic
half-way, or more, to meet the ludo-European dialects of
Western Persia. Be it so. The Armenian lauguage is a
stumbliug-block. lt ought, from its geography, to be iuter-
mediate to the Sauskrit and Lithuauic- whereas, that it
ie ludoEuropeau at all is more than many good judges
allow it to be. At any rate, it is uot what it ought to be
for the hypothesis-transitional in character.
