'l'he three texts of demandes, Paulus Diaconos, and the
Traveller's Song, give us the ronglr materiale for the criticisnr
of the traditione of the Gothic nation. Their historical and
ethnologioal value is another question.

To begin with Jornandes. He quotes more than one

. earlier than himself, ay, Dio, Dexippus, and Ablavins. For

contemporary events, any statement of any such writer is
valuable.

But what is the valae of such earlier writers, iu respect
to the times anterior to their ownl in respect to the archae-
ology, ethnology, or affluar of the Gothic natione!

Many put this high; since the Germania of Tacitus espe-
pecially mentions the existence of carmina antiqua, and
acoess to the carmina antiquo is what may fairly be allowed
to Ablavias at least.

The following facts, however, subtract from their valae :-

o. Adoptations to the traditione of other nations (real or
supposed), known to J ornandae and Paulus Diaconos through
their ecclesiastical and classical learning ere heterogeneously
intermixed with the proper Gothic narratives.

h. ln the ease of Jornandes, numerous real or supposed
facts, relating to the Geta, are confused with those relatiug to
the Gothi.

These objections are of special application.. To which
must be added those which apply to tradition in general;
even in its most nnexceptionable form. Upon these, however,
the present is no place for enlarging. The only question, at
present, under notice, is the extent to which the migratione,
which we find in the two Latin writers (for the Treveller's
Song has but little in this way), rest upon true and genuine
tradition-true and genuine tradition being the transmission
of the account of an actual event from one generation to
another, by rnrwritten communication.

For this. it is absolutely necessary that the event trans-
