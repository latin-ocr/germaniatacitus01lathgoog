On the Evidence of a (lonnectiou between the cimbri and
the Chersonesus Cimbrica. By Dr. R. G. Latham.

It is considered that the evidence of any local connection
between the cimbri conquered hy Marius, and the (lher-
sonesus Cimbrica, ie insufficient to counterbalance the natural
improbability of a long and difficolt natiouel migration. Of
such a connection, however, the identity of name sud the oon·
current belief of respectable writers are primd faeie evidence.
This, however, is disposed of, if such a theory as the following
can be established, eia, that, for certain reasons, the know·
ledge of the precise origin eud locality of the uatious con-
quered hy Marius was, at au early period, confused aud inde-
finite3 that new countries were mede known without giving
any further information; that hence, the locality of the cimbri
was always pushed forwerda beyond the limite of the geogra-
phical areas accurately ascertained3 and finally, that thus
their supposed locality retrograded continually northwards,
until it fixed iu the districts of Sleswich and J ntlaud, where
the barricr of the sea, and the increase of geographica] know·
ledge (with one exception) prevented it from getting further.
Now this view arises out of the examination of the language
ot' the historiens sud geographers as examined in order, frorn
Sallust to Ptolemy.
