lance. There were several limites, or wooden causeways,
through the foreste and marshes, running from the Rhine as
far as the river Lippe, and through Westphelia, to the river
Weser. These reads were similar to the one between st.
Petersburg and Novgorod‚ and Moscow. Varus was led
hythe conspirators to abandon these straight roads, and as
he ventured deeper into the country, the revolt became gene·
ral, and the Romans found themselves outwitted. Varus
tried to retreat and resch the causeway, probably with a
view of defending himself in the fortress of Aliso ou the Lippa.

The question about the exact spot where the battle of
Varus was fought, is one of those which, in my opinion, can
never be satisfactorily auswered. The only sensihle 'and prac-
tical mode of investigating the matter, would beto examine
from what point a Roman road may have been made into
the country of the Germana, and I imagine that (lologne was
a convenient point to start from, but the difficulties were
pretty nearly the same everywhere. Itis infinitely more
difficolt to determine enything upon this point, than to trace

On the first day, Varus was attached on all sides, audet

harder, but he continued his march. The terror and con-

they were about to pitch their camp, tho soldiers could
hardly resist the attach. Varus was at last quite overcome
hythe consciousness of his hopeless situation and his respon-
sibility; and he had several of his officere put an end to their
lives. lt was probably at that moment that Numonius Vala
(apparently the person to whom Horace addressed his epistle)
separated the cavalry from the infantry, and endeavoured, but
unsuccessfully, to escape with hie three squadrons alone. They
too were overwhelmed, just as they deserved to be, for
having abandoned their companions. On the third day, the
whole of the Roman army was annihilated, only a few escap-
ing with their lives. The Germane tpols awful vengeance
upon their oppressore: many of the Roman prisoners were
