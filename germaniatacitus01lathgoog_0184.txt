sorssors suerrus ιι. 41

To here giren, however, the nome to e wsepon‚ mentioned by
l'scitus end Juvenel, they must hore existed under thet nome
in the first—existed, ss it were, in e latent stete, end unknown es
Franks to the legions end vmmsnders' who conquered them. Ι
scarcely think thet this strengthens the csse.

Still the derirntion moy be both wslid end wulueble. It moy
teech us to loch sor the B'rooks mors closely, end, cousequently, ιο
find them earlier then is supposed. .

It hes done this in the cese oi its chief supporter. Ptolsmy
mentions s people called, Ἀναρτοφροκτοι, in Pannonia-ond these
ure considered to he Φροκτοι, οι Φραγκοι.

Βιιι Pennoniu ise long wey from the Frank country. Not
too fur for en etymologist. They cerne from the lieet, es, in the
eyes of the etymologist, sll populatione do.

Sigcbertus Gemblecensis writes, “Francis post Priamum, Priami
filius Marcomeres et Sunno filins Antenoris principentur ennio
xxxvi, qnorum ducatu Franci Sicambris egressi consedere secus
Rhenum in oppidis Germanico?

Here the foros ol etymology stops, ior it hes not hitherto gone so
for us ιο connect frooceo with King Priom.

But, though ull this moy be wrong, there was reully e relationship
between the Franks und the Pannoniam Yes; Augustus plunted
u sennocae* legion in Hungury. No such Sicambrien colony,
however, will mehe Ἀνορτοφροκτοί Franks, or deduce the subjecte
ol Oloris from the Danube, uny more thou our Indisn possessione
will make Loudon o colony ol Gulcuttu

Now the previous doctrine is not the fruit of the old empiricul '

etymology, which took no οοοοιιιιι of consonents, ond looked upon
vowcls ns nothing, hut the result ot* those so-culled ison-bound
’ lewe ol letter-change, which lead their supporters ιο demur to
deducing pfriemc from framea.

There ere certain things less legitimetely msrrmed then en nn-
menngeeble letter-change 3 ond s migretion which connects the

Franks to Ἀνιιριοφρακτοί is oue of them.

'Phe doctrine exhibited chose is Jemes Grimm’s.-D. S. i. 512
-5 .

th the change from sr-, to pso, is by no meens u serious dil-
ficulty; since there is no prooi of its ever haring tehen ploce.
