kind of Oorvcy (i. p. 6:34) ‘⁶ Saevi vero Tronehoduni illam

lv. Tin Nemori, or Nordoaquooi.-lu King Theodobert's
Epistle to the Emperor J ustinian we find the name Narravi
ol which tho more correct form is probably Nor-soloci, or
Nurritani-‘⁶ subactis Thuringis. . . Noreouorum gentis nobis
placata majestas colla subdidit.''-Ducherne‚ i. 862.

lu the Annales Mettenses ad au. 748 (Perta i. 330), “ Pip-
piuus adunato exercitu per Turingiam iu Saxoniam veniens
fines Saxonum quoa Nordoaquooos coenat, eum valida manu
intravit. Ibique duces gentis asperae Solavorum in occursum

parati, pugnatores quasi centum millia. Saxones vero, qui
Nordoaquuoi vocantur, sub suum ditionem subactos contritos·

Now Zeuss identifies these Noreuooi with the Saevi

alittle consideration will show that it by uo means follows,
that because the Saevi Troasbudoni were Saevi in tho North
they were, there, the Nordauuoi.

A Liuoolnshire colony in the East Ridiug of Yorkshire‚
would certainly he Englishmeu North os llo flumbo, yet
they would not be N orti-malliana.

Iam iudueed to draw the distinction from the following
facts:—

o. All the extracts in Zouss—the oues on which all my
knowledge of the subject rests-call those Saevi of whose
colonial character there is the elearest evidence-not Nord-
euooi, but simply Suum.

l. The Nord-auuca' are spoken of as a gens.

This seems a sufficient reason for discounecting-

o. The ueni of the settlemeut founded in Alboiu's time

b. Nord-aaooi of the pens, conquered by Theodobert.

The rcasouing hitherto has been that the word Saea, ori·
ginally Keltic‚ was applied to the Seuthem Germaus exclu-
sively‚ so that it was Keltic in the way that Tslocl is Slavouio:
