Such ia the evidence 01 those writers, Greek 01 Roman, who
deal with the local habitation 01 the Cimbri rather than with
the general history 01 that tribe. As a measure 01 the inde-
finitude 01 their ideas, we have the confusion, already notieed‚
between the Cimbri aud Cimmerii, on the parts 01 Diodorus,
Strabo and Plutarch. A better measure occurs in the follow-
ing extract from Pliny, who not only fixas the Cimbri in three
places 01 01100, but also (aa far aa we can find any meaning in
his language) removes them so 101 northward as Norway:
“Alterum genus Ingaevones; qnorum pars Cimbri, Teutoni, ac
Chaucorum gentes. Proximi Rheno Istaevones; quornm pars
Cimbri mediterranei.'’-iv. 28. “Promontorium Cimbrorum
excurrens in maria longe peninsulam efficit, quae Cartris appel-
latur.''-Ibid. 27. ‘⁸ Sevo Mons (the mountain-chains 01 Nor·
way) immanem ad Cimbrorum usque promontorium efficit
sinum, qui Codanus vocatur, refertus insulis, quarum clarissima
Scandinavia est, incomperta magnitudinis.”-Ibid. Upon
confusion like this it is not considered necessary 10 expend
further evidence. So few statements coiucide, that under
all views there must be a misconception somewhere; and 01
such miscouception great must the amount be, to become
more improbable than a national migration from Jntland to
Italy.

Over and above, however, this particular question of evi-
dence, there stands a second one; uis. the determination 01
the ethnographical relations of the natione sinder considera-
tion. This is the point as to whether the Cimbri conquered
hy Marius were Celts or Gotho, ahin to the Canis, or akin to
the Germans; a disputed point, and 0110 which, for its own
sake only, were worth diseusaing, even at the expense 01 raising
awholly independent question. Such, however, it is not. 11
the Cimbri were Kelts‚ the improbability 01 their originating
in the Cimbrio Chersonese would be increased‚ and with it the
amount 01 evidence required; since, laying aeide other conai-
derations‚ the natural unlikelihood 01 0 large area being tra-
versed by a mass 01 emigrante is greatly enhanced by the fact
