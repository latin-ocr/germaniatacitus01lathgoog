· the ninth century, was undoubtedly divided between these

Lithuauians and Slavonieus, absolutely German even iu the
eyes of Tacitus. At the mouth of the Vistula the AEstyir‘
spoke a language like the Barata.

Let these AEstyiaus, on the strength of their sermo Bri-
taanisae propior, ba called the nonGermanic portianos the
so-called original Germanic area3 eud—-

Let the Praestent, on the strength of their Lithuanic
tangue, be called the noa-Slavouic portion of the some area as
it appears iu the rath century.

It will be found that the relation of the aoaSlavonic
portion of the Slavonian period, was exactly that of the aon·
Germanic portion during the Germanic period-in, both the
AEstyians aud Prussians occupied the seme locality.

Hence, the displacemeut of these BritanaoGormanio popu·
latinus (and the statement of Tacitus is as valid for the
AEstyians speaking a language like the British as for any
single fact connected with these parts) must have been accom-
panied with a remarkable act of discrimination—since the
parts occupied by the populations like the British became
Lithaonic aud not Slavonic, the remainder Slooonie aud
not Lithaaaic. This nice appropriation of different parts of
the different areas cannot be said to add to the probability
of the migration which must be assumed. Such a migratiou,
annihilatiug the population, traditione, and local names, and
all the substantial realities ofa vast district, and, yet, pre-
serving the sarm of its ethaological area, is, to say the least,
a very remarkable one; since it gives us a pheuomenon
which is better ascertaiued in chemistry than in history, aa,
tlte plenonanon of replaeement aad substitution.

A ihrther consideration of the probabilities herein involved
will be found iu the notes ou the word AEstyii.

But it may be urged that the langnage of Tacitus respect-
ing the liapaa Britannica propior mast not be taken too
closely? Granted. But what statement is more explicit.
If we doubt or qualify this, why not doubt or qualify much
more; ay, tbe Germanic position of the Lygii. This is what
should be done. Α11 that is required is consisteucy.
