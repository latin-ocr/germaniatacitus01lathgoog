nnequivocally Sarmatian, without traca or vestiga of any pre·
vious Germanic population—no German names for the rivers
or mountains, and no Germanic strongholds in any of the
impervious foresta aad impracticable lena-no traditione on
the part of the Sarmatiam of their own comparatively recent
arrival in the country. That any portion of the present Ger-
manic population of the countries in question is descended from
an ancestry earlier than an. 800, is what no one has ever
ventured to essert, so evidently isit of recent origin, and so
totally has any older population-if such ever existed—died
off without leaving trace, or shadow of a traca, of its
existence.

Pammenia, East os tle Oder. - Adam of Bremen first
mentions these Pomeranians, and he mentions them as Slavo-
nians, the Oder being their boundary to the west. On the
east they were conterminans with the Prassians. Their name
is Slavonic, por-on and more=saa,=cooatmaa. All their
antiquities and traditione are equally so; in other words there
is neither evidence, nor shadow ol evidence, of their ever
having dispossessed an older Germanic population. Nor are
' they wholly extinct at the present moment. On the promon-
tories which project into the Gulf of Dantzig we find the
Slavonic Kossaid, Generatim, or Kasud. Their language
approaches the Polish.

Pomeraaia, accat os rto Odor, aad tle eastern part os Mark-
lendary.-No definite notices of these parts occur before the
time of Gharlemagne. From that time downwards‚ however,
they arc numerous. The only Germana that they recognize are
the conquering invaders. On the other hand, the Slavonic
populations are carefully enumerated‚ and so thoroughly do
they fill up the whole area that there is neither noolr nor
cranny l'or any thing German. The chief nationis that of
the Wilzi, Welatabi, or Liutici, falling into the minor divi-
sions of the otterici, near the present town of walstoch, the
circipani, on the coast opposite the lsle of Rugen, the To-
tonat, on the Tollensee‚ and the narrarit of the civitas Ilattra.
Now, whatever the others may have been, these last were nc
new-comere, since the town was praeminent lor its antiquity,
and the temple which itcontained celebrated forits sanctity.
