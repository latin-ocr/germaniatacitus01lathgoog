PROLEGOMENA. v

from taking up the question at the other end, beginning with
a lauguagc at the earliest period of its history, inverting the
previous process, and tracing its progress downwards l'rom its
first appearance in history to the present time.

We get, by this means, more than one additional Gothic
language. First and loremost eomes-

1. rto Memmia-The tribea who spoke this were the
Goths who conquered Moesia3 the date of its existence, as a
written language, being the fourth century. The Moeso-
Gothic has no living representative, that is, none of the
present dialects of Germany are direetly and nnequivocally
descended from it; although the Thuringian is, probably,
descended from some dialect originally allied to it. From
the fact of its being the oldest Gothic dialect of which we
have any specimen, the philological importance of the Moeao-
Gothic is very great.

2. we lammae-This is the present literary German as
it was written in the eigbtb, ninth, tenth, and eleventh cen-
turies, and as it was spoken on the Upper Rhine,-in Eadm,
Wurtcmburg, Switzerland, and Bavaria.

3. Tb Francia-This is German of the middle Rhine‚ as
it was written in the ninth and tenth centuries.

4. Tb Old Datelr, Flemielr, or Retovium-This is the pre-
sent Dutch of Holland iu its oldest form. It departs from
the Francic much aa the Francic dcperts from the Alemannic.
Hence the Dutch of Holland, and the Bavarian ol Bavaria,
may be considered as the two extreme forms ol one and the
same* group. All the present Platt·Deutsoh dialects of
Germany are either exactly derived from the Francic, or
from some form intermediate to the Francia and Batavian:
aview which will be noticed in the sequel.

5. Tb decom—This falls into two divisione, the Old·
Saxou of Westphalia, and the AngloSaxon of Hanover,
afterwards transplanted to Great Britain. The Saron lan-
guage is extinct iu Germany, being replaced by the Platt-
Deutsch derivativas of the Francic, or Franco-Batavian.

This circumstance supplies us witha principle of classifice·
tion, the Platt·Deutsoh dialect falling into two divisione-
