That there vas, at least, one body of Gauls ou the German side
of the Rhine, isa lact ιο which we have Caesar as awitness. llis
langusge respecting the Volcae Tectosages, is that of a man speaking

· to what he knovs at first-hand.

For the locality ef such Trans-Rhenane Gauls, in the time of
Gaear, no district has a better claim than Baden and Wurtem·
burg-the syri Decumates of Tacitus. We corne to this con-
clusion by the exclusive method. It was not Svitaerland, sor
that was Helvetium nor yet the Middle Rhine, since, in those
parts, there seems ιο have besu Germans of the Alemannic
division.

The impert of the name Voleae Tectosages is by no means clear.
of the two words composing it, the former (Volso) vves generic, the
latter (remma) specifio 3 since, besides the division in question,
there was a second—the Volcae Arecomici.

The area os the Volcae of Gaul in general seems tohave been the
parts between the libone and the Pyrenees3 but as the neme was
probably collective rather than special, the history οι the Voleoe of
Gaul is obscure. (laser mentions them only incidentally.

How the Gauls beyond the Rhine came thither is another ques-
tion. They may have done so by simple intrusion, rie, just as
Caesar was told they did. This intrusion may have been either
early or late-as late aethe times approaohing those of Caesar
himself, or earlier than the well-known migration--real or sup-
posed-described by Livy, and referred to the reign ol' Tarquinius
Priscus—Lib. v. 34, 35.
