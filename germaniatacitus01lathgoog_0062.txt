of Canterbury, being (lanterbnry also. Nor yet any name
very similar to it, ench as Oaranbary, Kartlury, tro.

Though this ie an extreme case, it illustratas the points of
question-it being assumed, of course, that the similarity rs
wholly accidental. lf Englishmen had been there previously,
the case would be different. The similarity would then be
other than accidental; and a connexion ot some sort or other
between the districtiu which the settlement took place, and the
district from which thesettlers originated would account for it.

No one imagines Boston in Massacbusets ιο be a native
Indian name. Yet why should it ιιοι be sot Not because
the combination was either impossible or improbable t'or an
Indiam but because it is the name ola town in England-
from whence some of the settlers came, or upon which they
had their eye. Such is the fact; and it is a fact which
we should hare been nearly as sure ot, is the details of the
foundation of Boston of Massechusets were unknown, as we
are now·

The presence of Englishmen in the two Bostons would
haro ιιοοιι conclusire; the chauces against a people con-
nected with oue Baeton falling in accidentally with another
Boston ready·made (as it were) in respect to name, being
incalculably great. ’

Βιιι what if the Boston in Massachusets were the older
name of the twot Difficulties would arise. We could not
then derive it from the Boston in Lincolnshire.

It is not necessary ιο carry this hypothetical illustration
farther: mantis mutandis, the argument which it involves
applica to the Gotho and the Geta.

a. The names are alike: indeed by the later writers Geta
is used as equivalent to Geraia· and in Pliny we find Gauda
by the side of Geta.

b. The supposed country οι the Goths is Gernrany: the
undoubted country of the Geta is the Lower Danube.

o. Of the two names that of the Geta is the older.

ln this case we really hauathedifficulty so lately indicated.
Emigrants, with the nanae Gothi, leave Germany; and, of
all the countries in the world, settle in one belonging to a
people with a name so like their own as that of the Geta acci-
