Instead, theu, of doubtfully suggesting the identity cf cisa and
Isia, name for caucasis done by (lumin, I have no hesitation in
assenting ιο it.

Whether traces of the characteristic mciqicm can be found
in an equally satisfactory form, is another question. A long
quotation from Rodolfs Ohronicle cf the Ahbey of St. Trudo,
is to be found in D. M. i. pp. nst-241. It tells us that, nn.
1133, the country-people of the neighbourhood made a ship, put it
on wheels, rolled it about from town to town, end attonded it with
song and dance from Tongres to Louvain.

Thia was done to annoy the weavers. It also annoyed the
clergy. So much so, that such expressions as accim infausto conisae
compactam -pentifitctis studium-profanos simulacri modim-ler-
labantur ct comburatur—umboni spiritus qui irc illc serebantur-
c'csoccti coticis morostrcm, dcc, occur in the account.

I agree with Guium in thinking this particular procession,
although mentioned as a single instance, tc have been but the last
of many previous ones—in other words, a ccoiool of an old custom.

I also believe its origin to have been pagan.

But I am not satisfied that it has anything ιο do with either
Isis or Ziza.

c. The locality of the processioa was the parts about the Lower
Rhine and Mosella, that of Ziza, Bavaria, and that of even the Isis
of Tacitus the country of only porc Suevorum; so that whilst the
deity ia preeminently local, the custom is spread over a vast
area.

t. Processions of the lrind in question are common, without being
connected with one another. The celebration of the breaking-up of
the ice, and the beginning of the reason for navigation might easily
be celebrated on the Danube and on the Rhine with a similar cere·
monial, without the necessity cf supposing the one to have borrowed
the custcm from the other.

Something of this lrind I imagine tc have been the case with the

supposed analogue of the mcipicm Indis in Germany, boats being .

wheeled about at the beginning cf the sailing season, just as on the
ach of J anuary, or Plocpbhfonday, the labouring men cf some parts
of Englaud go about as Plocpb-bqu cr Plocpfi-hulloclrs

That either the Isis of Tacitus, or the Ziza* of the flugshurgers

⁸ Supposing them (aa l do not) tc bc differant taines.
