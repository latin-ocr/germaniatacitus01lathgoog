member the construction ol the time Romarm to Domitian. Why
then use such epitheta as probably? Nino-tantbs of the admitted

’ facts in history, is less supported by evidence than the seduction ol

the Decumates agri, anterior to the reign ol Nerva This isa
point to which eren the present passage bears testimony.

Under N erra there was a ‘⁴ little war in Suebis, the only traca of
which existe in an inscription, in which mention is madoci a aio·
torsa Sacaira'’ 'Phia was in al or 89, a-n.-Niebuhr's·Lectures.

Under Trajan and Adrian, the relations between Rome and Ger·
many were peacelul.-Ditto.

In the reign ol Antoninus Pius “we hear ol a delensive war
against the chasti.”-Ditto.

The great Marcomannis war characterized the reign of Aurelius
Antoninus. In this, the tribes on the Decumatian frontier took
some, but not the main, part This was chiefly in the hands ol the

Alamannos, gentem populosum, ex equo mirifice pugnantem, prope
Manum amnem devicit.”·-Aur. Victor, de Cas. c. 21. ¹

This is the first time the important name Alamanni occurs, and
lor that reason the notice ol the agri Decumates has been brought
down thus low (sm. 215); since the agri Decumates, and the parts
to the north and east ol them, form the great Alemannic area.

Further notice of these Germana will be found in Ilpilepomeaa,

In saying that “in the time of Tacitus the agri Decumates had
been appropriated by Rome,” l mean not that it was settled, or
organized, but that it was kept aa a March or military sroats‘er. A
debatable land ol this kind is the Suerio Waste, as described by
Oscsar. I believe thet at the present moment a portion ol the
Austrian end Ottoman frontier is in this condidam-oia, Turkish
Oroatia, between Austrian Oroatia, Hersegowina, Bosnia, and
Slaronia

Politically, the Decumates cyri coincide with the modern Duchy of
