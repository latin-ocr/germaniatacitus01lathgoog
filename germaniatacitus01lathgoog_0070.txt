great likclilrood, because Iam unwilling to overstate the case.
Morka of minor magnitude may have existed-marks between
different members of the same stock; between, for instance,
the (latti and Cherusci, the Cherusci and Chauci, &a This,
again, is what we lind at home. The Welsh marchae sepa·
rated the Saxou from the Kelt: the Scottish‚ the southrou
Saxon from the northern. Still l think that the existence of
a march, sufficiently important to be mentioned hythe Roman
historiens, is prlmd socie evidence of the existence of an
ethnological difference of considerable magnitude.

3. The third is the linear character of the dimensione of a
march. A bonndary which separates one area from another
is surely narrower than either of the meas which it separates.
A march as broad as it is long is no march at all. To this,
however, there is an objection. One nation may so encroach
upon another that the march, or line of bonndaries, is cou-
tinnally advancing. Now if the nome be retained whilst the
line becomes protruded‚ the dreodtlt ol a march may become
as notable as its length. Thus, il the North American
settlers had called each county which ahutted on the Indian
frontier the march, and if those connties had retained their
names, there would now be a series of areas, so named,
reaching from the Atlantia to the Rocky Monntains. And
this is really the cose in Germany, where we have the oldest
line of frontier between the Slavonians and Germane, called
All-morl (the obl march) ; the next, Mittel-mark (the middle
march); and the third, Ualen-snaed the moreh ol‘ the Ucrii'
(a Slavonic population so-called).

4. There is also another element ol‘ uncertainty. Suppose
the Humber was called the river March. The people on it
might be called Morchmeu, though not ou a march. ln such
a case, certain Yorkshiremen wonld appear to form the fron-
tier, when, really, they did not do so. By this, the writer
who argued from the name only would imagine that the
non-English area began at Hnll instead of at Roxburgh;
and the English area would lose all Yorkshire, Dnrham, and
Northnmberland.

Now, reverse this supposition, aad let the Spey be called
the March. ln this case, the men on its banks would appear
