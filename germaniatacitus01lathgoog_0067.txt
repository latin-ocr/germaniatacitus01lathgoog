ln the name Cherusci some ol' the best writers ef Germany
find the root demeruerat. Hence, the Cherusci are smerde,
and, by extension, awende-meu.

But there is another nation mentioued by Tacitus, called
Scardona. Suerd=rword‚· and, hence, Oleruaoi=Suord=
orus, and uice arrad.

Thirdly, as ruhr=dupyerr dupper=rroord the Sorores are
the men of the suls. Hence, Saeoa=Suurdouee=Olrerresoi‚
and the three tribes are the same.

l give this as an illustration of an investigantium valuahle,
if true. But the truth is doubtful.

ln most investigatione of this sort, two series of facts are
overlooked.

l. The language ιο which the derivational process is
applied-How many have sought for a German meaning
ιο the word Germani, without submitting it to the previous
inquiry as to whether the name were German at all.

2. The likelihood of the name iteelf.-··I will not deny
that natione may he found who give themselves sueh names
as Sroord, Dupyer, Kaisa, &a Ι only argue that the induetion
by which such names can be shown fitting ιο an unknown
case, hae yet ιο be made.

A fuet that emiuently invalidates this kind of criticism.
is the habit of numerous natione themselves. Many of them
are ao fer from supposing that their name has an intelligible
origin, that they exhibit an unconscious confession of their
ignoranee. The Greeks (for instance) and many Oriente!
natione explain their name by supposing that it is that of
the patriarch of their stock-their eponymus. Thus the
' Hellana darive themselves from Hellen, the Turta from
Turk, &a They would not do this if, in the full command
of their own tangue, and in a period comparatively near
the origin of their name, there was some custom or attri-
buta connected with themselves which would explain it
better.

I think the etymology of steph uaeompouuded national
names dangerous and unscientiliu. In a few cases it is admis-
sible—but only in a few. Iu the present volume I adopt the
accredited meaning of three simple uueompoueded names only
