I have said that the undoubted use of the root Suco-,⁴ as
applied by certain Germane to themselves, is the only sti-orry
reason against the original noa-Germanic character of the
word. As others, however, may bc satisfied with the fol-

the middle Attta‚† aud the Σουήβοι Σεμνάνες extending from

This division introduces a difficulty which even a migratiou

will not explain.
The Suevi os Suabia are High Gemens.
