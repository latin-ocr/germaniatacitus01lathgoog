It cannot be denied that the contraet between the evidence
of Tacitus, who wrote from what he heard in the second,
and the evidence of the authors cf the time of Charlemagne,
who wrote from what they baem, in the nintb, is remark·
able. What are we to sayl

l. That the evidence of Tacitus must be impugned.

2. That the evidence of Tacitus must be limitcd.

3. Or, that a vast system of migratione and displacements
must be assumed, in order to reconoile the first accurately
known state of things with the testimony os a writer whom
we arc unwilling to take exceptione tol

Whiohcver of these views be adopted, our decision ought
to bo made after a very carelul and mature deliberation.
There are complicatione ou both sides, and the whole ques·
tion is a balance of conflicting difficulties.

The occupation of the tract of country between the Tletula
and the Elbe in the tenth century by Slavonians is primd
sacia evidence of a similar oocnpancy in the second.

The term Gerontia, applied to the same by Tacitus, is
primdsact‘e evidence the other way. To decide in favour of
a Slavonio population on the strength of the former fact,
irrespective of the conflicting testimony of Tacitus, is illegi-
timate; but it is equally so to take that testimony without
doubt, qualification, or scrutiny. To place evidence opposed
to the a priori probabilities upon the same level with evi-
dence supported by them is unscientific in the extreme;
indeed the writer who does it places all evidence on the
same level, and requires the same amount of testimony for
probabilities and improbabilities, for the barely possible and
lor the morally certain.

Ol all the populations east ol the Elbo which Tacitus, in
tho second century, called Gemuere, no single vestige appears
in the tenth. How is thiat Was tlrc original statement
