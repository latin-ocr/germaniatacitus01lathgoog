IV. Is there any connection between the Getae of Mesia
and the Gothini, the Gethones‚ the GothlanderS, the J ut·
landers, hro, all or any? In pntting this question, vve mum
remember that the country of the Gctae is the country of the
Gotho also.

The difficulty involved heroic, has already been incli-
ested*

So has the explanation ol the greatest Gothic scholar
living.

The present writer, in admitting the difficulty, differs
from Grimm, by admitting the morarios from Germany also.

But he believes that that migration was not undertaken
by Germane calling themselves Gotho.

He finds no evidence that they called themselves so before
they reached the country of the ceto.

They theo took the name, aad not bosom just as the
Keot-ings of Anglo-Saxon England took e name from the
Keltic county of Kcot.

This, however, is only a preliminary consideration. The
real question is whether, or not, the similarity of neme be·
tween the Got- of the Lower Danube and the G-rl of
Gallicis and Prnssia be accidentali or is it referable to
ethnologicalconnectionl

In this case, the distance is sufficient to admit of the
resemblance to be occidental ; end Ι do not precs the relation·
ship. Still l believe in it.

The same Slavoniens who, as frontagers, called the one
Guddco, were the frontagers to the Gotoe also.

In this case the connexion is votat, ic, it isos the same
sort which gives the same name to the Wolrh ol Britain,
and the Italicos, whom the Germane called Wolsh also.
The Germanic populations, which fill up the interval, agree
in calling their oonGermanic neighbours by some form of
the root W·l.
