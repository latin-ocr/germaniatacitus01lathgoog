now become in the eyes 01 the Bacticis-c, what all that was other thau
Roman was before. The standard has changed. Barbarism is
measured by its departure from what is Dat-sole,· in other words,
the term has beeonm so little derogatory as to have become national.

From the two facts of Germania being no native name, and Deut-
sobc being one of late origin, we arrivs at an inierence of great prac-
11011 importunae in ethnological criticism, aia, that, although the
Romans and the Ganls knew the populations beyond the Rhine by
a common collective term, no such common collective term 111111 10
heve been used by the Germane themselves. 1111111111, Each
tribe hadita own designation; or, at most, each kingdom or eon-
federatiou. Only when the question as 10 what was commento
the whole country, in opposition to what was Roman or Gaits'c,
became a great practical fact, did a general ethnological term ariae ;
and this was not Garnae, but Dutch.

This is 1 common phenomenon. In Hindostan we hear of the
wilder mountaineem of Orissa and the Mehratta country under the
names of 1161 and Khond ς and thir is a collective term. But it is
only this iu the mouth 01 1 Hindu, 01 Englishman. Amongst
themselves the separate names 01 the different tribes is all that
is current.

From this it follows that, Germania being a aon-Germanic term,
its claime 10 absolute ethnological accuraoy are reduced. It is like
the term Gallia ,· which was so 11111011 containing nothing but Gallio
Kolta (or, ehanging the expression, Keltic Gaulo), that it included the
Iberia populations 01 Aquitania, which wera as unlike the true Gaul
as a Basque of the Pyrenees is unlike a Welshman. Hence, when·
ever we are disposed to doubt whether so valuabls a writer as
Tacitus could have committed the error of making any particular
aoceGermanio tribe German, we must remember that so well-iu·
formed 111 observares Caesar makes the Aquitani, Gallie.

Itis also important to remember that, like high as opposed to
low, rich to poor, dic, the word Dect-soli was originallya corre·
tesia term, a'.e., it denoted something which was popular, calyce,
azotioaol, ualeamecd, to something which was not. Hence, it could
have hed no existence until the relations between the learned and
lettered languaga 01 Rome, and the comparatively unlearned and

unlettered osdgar 10191101 the Franks and Alemanni had developed
