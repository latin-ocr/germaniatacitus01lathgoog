that ol the (lircassians, and the same in kind with that of the

belonging to that stoeh.

Zeuss, however, whose account of all such natione asne

unexeeptionable as it is valuable, makes them Turlrs, and so,
perhaps, do the majority of writers who have gone beyond

The first step towards ensuring ourselres against being
misled by the similarity of names Hor and Hau-gary is to
remember that the names Welslmoa and Greek are not more
