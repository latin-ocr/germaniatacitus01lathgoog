the interpretatio Romana fixed upon Wodcn as tbe corresponding
god to Mercury, we do not clearly sec ,· but we are not acquainted
with the rites and legende which may bave mado this perfeotly clear
to the Romana.”—Saxons in Ilnglend, rol. i. 338. Other facts
deepen the shadc of this difficulty. Adam of Bremen, iu hie de-
scription of the temple at Upsela, writes: “ Wodanem vero sculpunt
armatum, sicuti nostri Mos-tem sculpere solent.”

N ewertheless, is some known god must be the analogue of Tacitus's
Mes-cury, and if-besides this—it must be his wsibutcs that deter-
mine the correspondenoc, Woden's claim-as aforesaid-is the best.

But another series of facts make it possible that the correspond-
enos was determined less by the attributes than the acme.

ln more than ono ol the Gothic lenguages we have a dialogus in
which one oi the interlocutors is Solomoc. Solomon exhibite bis
wisdom in a series ofanswers putto him by agibing ironist-who, in
the AngloSaxon dialogus, is called Saturnus, but in several of the
Frenoh ones Marcou, the fuller and older lorm oi which is ΜανοοίᾕΙ
Mr. Komble in his editiones the AngloSaxon work for tbe AEllric
Society, bas given elaborate reasons for believing that the Marcols is
Saturwus, and uice owed. The sort of fiction is a common one,
Shrewd common-sense on one side, viewing all things in a practicsl
light, and tincturing all things with e caustic irony, is brought into
collision with the higher wisdom of a truc sege 3 and, upon tho
ground ofa fool being able to ask more questions in an bour than a
wiso man can answer in a day, succeeds in pumling the higher wis·
dom of bis opponent.

Now Marcols is a German name ς and although the Marcols of
the dialogus may hare grown out of the Mercurius of the Glsasics,
after being introduced on German ground, be may eleo have had an
independent origin, and have been German from the beginning.

If so, thie origin may have been aa old as the time of Tacitus, so
that that writer’s analogue of his own Mercury may bave been what,

subsequently, became Moroolf or Marone-the omme being like, and
the attributes not unlike,

Again-tbere is another view which may be taken.

The reasoning which has applied to the German analogue of Mars
may, possibly, apply bere also. 'lbere may bave been a nome similar
to the Greek Idrwscs .· in which case tha process ola Glassioal writer

would be, first to identily the deity with a Greek god, and then to
give the result in a Latin denominativa
