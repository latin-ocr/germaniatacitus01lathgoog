EPILEGOMENa lxxv

It is when we ean find an undoubtedly Germanic popula-
tion in this country of Salacia calling themselves Sacri,
that the reasons in favour of its native origin begin to pre-
ponderate; since the indigenons nse of the name at one time
is strong primii sacis evidence of its indigenous use at
another.

Whethsr, however, it be strong enough to set against the
series of facts with which the investigation commenced‚ com·
bined with the easy explanation of them by the hypothesis
that the word was originally other than German, is submitted
to the consideration of the reader.

All the difficulties are reducible tc a single fact, cia,
that the present undoubtedly German name Suedio has arisen
out of a Roman rather than a actiae appellation-the &aura
name itself having arisen out of a Keltic, the Keltic, perhaps,
ont of a Slavonic. Whoever makes a difficulty of this should
remember that the word Gemmay itself is in the same
predicament.

But this implies that the ancestors of the present Suebiam
became sufficiently Romaniaed to take for themselves arrational
name, which the Romans had originally taken from the Gauls
-a strange name, in short. The following extracta suggest
the answer to this :—

“ Avitus, on his arrival in Rome, was acknowledged
emperor; but Ricimer, a Suevian of royal descent, was now
all-powerful in the city. All the barbarizans, who acteda
prominent part at Rome, must uot be looked upon as savages;
they were Christiane, and spoke and understood the lingua
culparis, which already resembled the Italian more than the
Latin; they were just as civilised as our ancestors in the
middle ages. A few ol them had a shadow of classical edu·
eation, as Theodosio, the Visigoth, and the younger Alaric:
but the case was quite different with Ricimer and his equale,
who no doubt heartily despised the culture of the Romans.
These Germana, unfortunately‚ were not one shade better
than the effeminate Italians; they were just as faithless and
cruel. * * ⁴⁸ ¹⁸ Gundebald, king of the Burgundiaas,
who had now become patriciae, and succeeded Ricimer, pro·
