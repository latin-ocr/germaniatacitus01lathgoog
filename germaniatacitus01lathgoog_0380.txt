Erlnsoonana.

§ xri. raa aunonnnrsns.

A document of ab. 786, in notieing the high tract of lando
between Ellwangen and Anspaoh‚ has the following expres-
sion—in waldo, qni vocatur Viryoooio.

Grimm loolrs for tho derivation of this word in the Moeso· ·
Gothie word fairguni, Old High German ferganni = woody
lillrongo.

He also quotes the variations Voryoot, Viryondo, and
Virynondio.

Ι have little doubt but that this is ths name of the tract
of land from which the name Boryoodi arose; and that it
is the one which fixes their looality.

Maius and Neolsr.

Burgundians more exclusively in tho direction of Gaul.

Mutato mutandis, the latter were in Burgundy, what the
former were in Alsatia with this differente, that the Ger-
mans of the former area have now become Gallieized.

No section ol the Germano exoeeds the Burgundians, in
the extent to which real or aooredited acts of their historieal
great men, have developed themselves into legend; Gonthen
Gundobald, and others, being the great senties ol tho Bur·
gundian cyole.

1. Part ol the Burgundian history is probably told under
that of the name of Froala, sines, it is not likely that,
between the Germano who garo the namo to Burgundy‚ and
the Germane who gave the name to Fraoolellomte‚ there was
much ethnological difformes, even if there were politieal
ones; in other words, it is likely that some Burgundians
were Franks. All were so in ons sense.-See § rrv.

2. Part ol the history whieh passos as Burgundian, ean,
on reasonable grounds, bs (leemod never to have been
burgundion at all; a fact which eomplioates the view οἰ
