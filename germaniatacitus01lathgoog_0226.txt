media aud Harudes 3 during the time of the Persian dominiou they
were goverued by native princes, aud aster the dissolutiones the
Persian aud Macedonian empireo, the latter of which had always
been least consolidated in Asia Minor, they extended themselves,
aud acquired considerable importante. Nicomedes, then king, took

those Gaulsiuto his pay, thero being then only ten thousand armed
men among them, defmted his rival, aud founded the Bithynian
stete, which gradually besam Helleuised. From that time, the
Gauls sold their services to any one who might seek thern, and made
the whole of western Asia tributary ιο themselves. Their history ie
yet in great confusion ; but it can be cleared up, many materiale
existing for it. They were defeated by Antiochus Soter, whereupou
they withdraw into the mountains‚ whence they afterwards burst
forth whenever circumstances allowed them, and all the neighbour-
iug natione paid tribute, to escape their devastatione. But when
the war between Ptolemy Euergetes aud Seleucus Callinicus, aud
afterwards that between the former aud Antiochus Hieras broke
out, they showed themselves thoroughly feithless‚ selling themselves
sometimes to the one, sometimes ιο the other, and were the seourge
of all Asia, until, to tho amusement ol every body, Attalus of Per-
gamus refused to pay tribute, attached and defeated them, a fact
which can be aocounted for only on the supposition, that through
idleuess they had becorrm quite effeminate and unwarlike, like the
Goths whom Belisorius found in Italy. They never entirely re·
covered from this blow, though they still continued to exorciso
considerable influcnoe, for Asia was always divided 3 and although
Antiochus was staying in those oountries, he was too much occupied
to turn his attention to them, and would not, moreover, hare been
able ιο protect that part of Phrygia borderiug ou the district inha-
bited by the Gaulo. Hence they still levied tribute far aud wide,
and after the fall of Antiochus, the Asiatic natione dreaded lest they
should be unable to defend themselves, This gave On. Manlius an
opportunity of undertaking a campaign against them, and to come
forward as the protector of the Asiatico against the Gelotiana His
demand that they should submit had been answered by those bar-
barians with a stolido ferocia, and ho accordingly marched through
Phrygia, and attached them in their mountains‚ without, however,
extirpating them. 'l'hey continued in those districts, aud preserved

their Celtic langarage for a remarkably long period. We find it
even in the time of Augustus 3 but they, too, became Helleuised,
