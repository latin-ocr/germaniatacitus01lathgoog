into Britain. But that, again, is to assume the point instead
of proving it.

Some, at least, of the Belgae, were Gallie in regard to their
constitution,-wituess the Eburones, who were clientes to the
Treuiri.

The names (ay, those beginning iu trc- aud coa) were

Gallio. This is an argument which the present writer, has,
at the first view, no right to use; he has so often suggested
theta populatiou speaking one language‚ might have a name
in another. ln this case, however, hc may do ⁸03 since
Gaesar was in the country of tho Belga, aud, if their names
were German, might have taken them in a German form.
Had he never crossed the Scine, it would not have been
illegitimate to argue, that Keltic names for Belgio localities
and populations, were not incompatible with a Germanic
descent for the people.

Neither is he, perhaps, justified in laying much stress on
the degree to which the extension of Germanic tribes to
the Scine, would dimiuish the Gallie population‚ supposed to
be so great; since he has shown but few scruples in contrast-
ing the Germanic. Still we must remember three points

a. F irst, that the recognition of the Belgae as German,
would subtract all the country north of the Scine, from
Gallia.

b. That it would place Germana on the Struits of Dover‚
the most prohable point for the introduction of the population
of Britain into Kent, a country which we know was not
German bnt Gallio.

c. Thac, as the Aquitanicus were Iberic, it would only
leave the parts between the Scine and Loire for the Kelts.

In tho analysis of the arguments in favour of a wide
extensiun of Germans into Gaul, it will generally he found-

a. That, as a general question, too much importance is
attached to the notiuu that common political relations
denote common ethnological ones.

b. That certain particular expressions of Gaesar, showing
that, iu some of the instances before us, there were specific
signs of Gallio origin, are omitted: aq, Gativolcus, a Belgica,

says, “ non facile Gallos Gallis negare potuisse.''-Bpll. Gall.
