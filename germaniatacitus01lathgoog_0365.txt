their neighbourhood-The Gothoncs are separated from the
Lygii, the Gothini from the Sarmata.

3. Both were-according to the evidence-neither Ger-
man nor Sarmatiam since the ›Sannotae treated tha Go-
thini aa clrhoipcnae, and the AEstii spolre what Tacitus calls
Brr'trhl.

Do these three points of connection establish an ethnolo-
gical affinity?

I will lay down what I conceive to he an hypothesis capable
of solving all, or nearly all, the difficulties arising from what

may be called the plari-promoto of the root (al-t, G-tl, in the !

two names under consideration.

This is as follows: the root, (ii-tl, was, in the case of Ι

the Slavouic and Lithuanian populations, in the same predi-
cament with the root (ἲν-ἦ, in the case of the Hellenic and
Italian.

With the Hellenes, I'goeiaor was the name of a single popu·
lation within what, in the eyes of a Roman, constituted the
Hellenic area; aud the name was, almost certainly, native.

With the Italians, it was the name, not only for that pnr-
ticular tribe, bnt for the collective Hellenos also.

Mutatio mutandis—With the Lithuanians the Ge (θ’-ἅ,
G-tt) was the name oi a single population within what, in the
eyes of a Slavonian, constituted the Lithuanic area, and the
name was, almost certainly, native.

With the Slavonians it was the name not only of that
particular tribe, hut for the collective lithuanicos also.

Thus—the AEetii of Tacitus, the Baete of the Germana,
were called Gcttones (Gotloues) by the more northern
Slavonians of their frontier3 just as the Γξαῒκοι of Epirus
were called Gracci hythe ltalians of the opposite coast.

And, the Gotlioi oi Tacitus were called by a similar name
by the more southern Slavonians of their frontier, just as the
Athenian Hellenas and others were called Graeci by the
Roman, Campanian, and other Italians.

Such is the hypothesis. Ι prefer this to helieving that the
Gothwtea and Gottioi were so much and so thoroughly one
and the soma scotico of the same hrocci as for them to have
borne the samo nume from Gallicis to Oourlnnd; in other
