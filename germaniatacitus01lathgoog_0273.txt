“ Chatti joined—“ donec in Chattos usque sinuetur.”

Considerations os this kind justify us in believing that, when oer-
tain great natione are spoken of as aetinga conspicuous part ln
history, certain minor ones may be included in the general name.

Hence, Ι believe that when the Cherusci are spoken of in general
history, the Chamavi and Angrivarii are included! in one ol the two
denominations3 and the words are used in apoliticul sense. 'l'he

Os the Socors division ol the German dialects as opposed to the
Platt-Deutsch and High German, and of the Saxon nationalities as
opposed tc the Frank, Alemannic, and Gothic, Lomhard und Bur-
gundian, the Cherusci are the southern representatives.
