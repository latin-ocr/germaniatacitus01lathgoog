one would call the retreat oi the ten thousand Greeks a migration
in the usual sense of the term.

In order to even approach the idea of a true migration, there
must be a fresh country ,· and there must be a de‘eeoatiaaity esserra
as well. In other words, a migration impliee the occupation of one
area by the inhabitants of another, combined with the ameoccapatiou
(ff tlte interueniuy perte. Without this letter element, it is a mere
extensiones frontier. 'ro apply au illustration already made, a
migratiou is like the knr'ybt's neore at ebesa

If these irteueaiey parts be portione of the ocean, ora river, their
non-occupation is a matter of course 3 and hence, migratione by
water are common. If, however, they be by aad, they are so rare
that, throuphout the sobole be'story of the Genaua atocla Ι know ao
unesceptionable instance osone.

Alsatia, Franchetlomte, Burgundy, Switzerland, and Franco (so
far seit is German), bessum Germauized by utendos offronte'er.

By aetenam offrontier the Slavonie tribes were displaeed.

Theoderici conquest of Rome was as little a miqrotimr ae the
seirure oi the empire by the hands ol any commender ,in Peu-
nonia would have been. It was amere military occupatiori.

uus Angla-Sason migration was by sca ,· aud that the Gothic,
invasione of Alaric aud others were the same, is highly pro-
bable. The Goths themselves, probably, reached Moesia by navigat·
ing the Danube. ’

For a migration to be aameeptiorsadle, the evidence ol its oecur-
rence must be unesceptr'orrable also ; aa, it must be reierable to
contemporary testimony. This is because migration was ae favente
a mode of aceouuting sor the more irregular distributione oi popula·
tion with ancient writers as it ie with modern.

'rus difference between migratione aud great military movemeuts
is difficult to draw. li, however, we chooee to distinguish between
an army with a number oi camp-followers, and a migration properly
socelled, by considering that the presence oi femalee, agad men,
and children, ie necessary to constitute the latter (making it a mowe-
meut, rostagni) the rarity of this presumedly common phenomenon
isiudelinitely enbauced-so much eo, theta land migration (ae
distinguished from one by water), a migration with separation from
the original area (ae distinguished from mere advanoa of montier), a
migration to a fresh land (as distinguished from a return), aud
a migration πανδημεί (as distinguished frema multitudinem army)
