Streho's notice of the Βιοοοίαιιι is us follows :-‘H δ’
ὑπερκειμένη πᾶσα χώρα τοῦ λεχθέντος μεταξὺ Βορυσθένους
real Ἴστρου, πρώτη μέν ε’στιν ἡ τῶν Γετῶν ἐρημία· ἔπειτα
οἱ Τυρυγέται· μεθ’ οὓς οἱ Ἰάζυγες Σαρμάται, καὶ οἱ Βασίλειοι
λεγόμενοι, καὶΟὖριγοι, τὸμὲν πλέον νομάδες, ὀλίγοι δὲ καὶ
’γεωργίας ἐπιμελούμενοι· τούτους φασὶ καὶ παρὰ τὸν Ἴστρον
οἰκεῖν, ἐφ’ ἑκάτερα πολλάκις. Ῥωξολανοι δ’ ἀρκτικώτατοι
τὰ μεταξὺ τοῦ Τανάϊδος καὶ τοῦ Βορυσθένους νεμόμενοι
πεδία. Ἡ γὰρ προσάρκτιος πᾶσα ἀπὸ Γερμανίας μέχρι τῆς
Κασπίας πεδιάς ε’στιν, ἣν ἴσμεν· ὑπὲρ δὲ τῶν Ῥωξολανῶν εἴ
τινες οἰκοῦσιν, οὐκ tepea-Strabo, vii. p. 306.

From this it follows that modern Ilum-iu has taken its
name, not-

α. From any dominant Norse conquerors, socalled, but—-

b. From a portion of its area called Βυοιιί, originally occu·
pied by Ugrian Βυοιοοῐαιιι, hut afterwards by Norsemen
(chiefly Swedes), to whom the neighbouring natione extended

the name of the territory.
ln other words, the Northmcn of Ruotsi were called Ilus,

even as an Angla of Britannia might he called Britannus.

The Ῥὣς were connected with the Voroopi, but, as the
Varuoye' were connected with the Franks in name only, the
two previous sections have been, to a certain extent, epi-
sodical.

I. True occupante of Frank localitiee, and probably true
members of a Frank confederaey are the θιαιιυατίι.

This is no Low German form of the word Olus-uorii,·
although, at the first view, it seems suoh; since the single e
has a less tendency to become t than the double one; or
(changing the expression), the High German a most usually
becomes ι in Low German when the vowel that precedes it is
short. Now, the ο in Olus-uarii is long; since it represents
the ο ἰο name of the river Haeo. Hence, Oloeuarii and
Olott-uarii are οοι in the seme relation to each other aa
