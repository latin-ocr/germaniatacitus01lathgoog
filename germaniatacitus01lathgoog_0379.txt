Neither must it bo too large; inasmnch as room must be
left for the equally important divisione of the Burgundiana
during the later, and lor the Goths of the Danube, the Thu-
riagians, and the (lhatti, in the earlier, period of their history.

Modern Soulia eomes under this category; so that modern
Scotto may be considered as the cocleae ol the Alemanno·
Suevio confederation.

Thet active emperor, Probus, coerced the Alemannir he
coerced them and something more. He recovered the whole
country of Suabia, and is said to bave reosteblished the lim

But from the time of Probus dou'nwarda the Alamanno-
Suevic enoroaobmeuts steadilyprogressed. Before a-n. 300,
they had become the ancestors of the present Germana of
Switzerland; and, by mn. 400, those of the Alsatians and
Bavariane.

Such was their time and scene. Strongly contrasted with
the Gotho, they edvauced their frontier gradually end oon·
tinuously; and the effect of this is, that oue hell of what at
present constitutes the HighGerman division, is of Alemanno-
Suevic origin.

Iu individual heroes this division is poor; none of its
kings or generals having the prominenoe of an Alaric, a
Theodoric, a Gundebald, or a (llovis.

Putting together what hes been said about the names
Alcameni and Saevi, it is just possible that, ot' the two chief

members of this alliance, those whose neme was German ³

were (lauls (the Alemanni), and those whose name was Gallie
(Sacer) were Germane. This, however, is a forcible way of
putting an apparent objection, rather than an objection itseli.

Is the Alemanni, originally, were not German, their
nationality and characteristics must heve merged into that
of the Snevi early.

Believing the Vendat to heve been Slavonio, the Alemanni
(supposing al- to mean olii) would be in the same relation to
the Saevi as the former wareto the Goths.

It is not superfluous to remark‚that the Alemanni and Alani
are undoubtedly confused by more thau one ancient writer,-
a pregnant source of difficulty, which itis not necessary at
present to enlarge on.
