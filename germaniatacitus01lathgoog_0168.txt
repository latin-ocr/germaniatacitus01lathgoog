gives us· a more Germanic form 3 sinos, by supposing the -nk to be
the adjectival ending preserved down to our own times in worda
like sels-iel, we have a truly Gothic termination. ¹Yet this is but
little. Patisco, if dealt with as an adjective derived from a simpler
form Teo, would still leave a difficulty: since it is not likely that
the name os a deity would be given inan adjectival form - ia, as
an epithet rather than as substantive name. Who ever heard of the
Greeks worshipping Ἀρειος (instead of Ἄρης), or of the Romans
considering Martiales (rather than Mars) as their founders fatherl
Precisely the same is the unlikelihood os Tuis-eo being an ad·
jective.

For this reading, however, Zeuss argues strongly3 and 1 draw
attention to his reasoning t'or the sake of objecting to it. It is clear,
that, when we say that such or such a form is the right reading,
hecauoe it gives us certain results, and then that those results are
to be admitted because such or such a reading is to be found, we
argue in a circle. The reading must stand onita own proper
grounds, ie, the value and number of the MSS. wherein it occurs.

the commentators on the Gemcania, ey.. in the case of the word
in question, Zeuss writes thus ε “ Tuisco (Tuisto is the wrong read·
ing), which is better with the vowel transposed (Tiuaco), is in
respect to its derivation like obeant, and is in the same relation
to 'l'iu (= deus) as the later form monbec, mere-niaco or cuneda is
to the older ntann.''-P. 72. .

Surely, instead os this bure statement, the collation of the MSS.
should have been laid before the render. ¹

Το such high authorities then as Zeuss, the adjectivul form of a
deity’e name is no objection. Neither does it seem to be eo to
Grimm, who, consequently, takes Prisco as the reading, and ry· as
the root. This latter is thus dcclined in the Norse of tha unda.
