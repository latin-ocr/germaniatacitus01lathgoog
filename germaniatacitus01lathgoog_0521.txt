So that to derive the German, Sicyonio, Lithuenir,
Greek and Latin from India, isto derive the greater from the
lese, the multiform from the simple, the admitted from the
doubtful. It ie to deduce the stook from the offshoot, to

move the earth with a lever in the clouds*
All such connectione ae thet between the Sanshrit end

⁸ Ι Ι must be allowed to remind the reeder thet from a desire tc deul with
the question as a questiones logie only, end with the wieh to underetete
rather than orereteto, my ecee, 1 argue entirely ee abundanti.

Thus-

n. Ι allow the Vedee to be four thousand yeare old-without believing
anything ol the kind.

t. 1 allow the Hindu, Beugali, Urdu, Gujerati. Mahrette, and modern
Persian tongues, to be ee truly Senskritic in origin ae the English is Anglo-
saxon-without believing it.

c. 1 allow the Armenian to be Indo-Europecn.

d. Also the Oeeetie. The only lecte respecting these leet three points
which 1 argue from, is the existence of doubts-not the validity ol them.

e. Ι luy no etreee ou the sentement that the third hnguege oi the cunei-
lorm inscriptionis other then Indo-Europeen.

f Ι carry the traces oi a Temulien tongue, anterior to the Hindu, no
further south then the parts about Bombey-

g, And the truces ol monosyllabic tongues, similarly anterior to the
Sanekrit, no further south then the Lower Ganges.

h. Ι nllow the Sieposh to be ee Seneltritie es the most extreme defendere
of ite Sonekritic origin melre it, and 1 place the Lughmeui, end other
dialects, es welles the Pustti ol Affghnnisten, in the seme category.

i. Ι luy no strees on the Temulian characteres the Breht‘ti, the numerale
ol which were admitted by hussen to be those ol Southern India.

On the other hand-

Ae Ι take exceptione to the ludo-European character ol the Keltie
tongues, end although 1 am, perhaps, the only philologiet who does, 1 tale
no advantage ol* the current opinion, by which the eontrast between the
differences between the eccelled Indo-Europeen tongues ol Europe end the
comparative homogeneousneae ol those ol Asin would be heightened.

Ι wieh to reduce the question to its logical form which is, that where rue
hone two hunela ostie tome division qs rpeect separated from ench other, one
os which ir tte lerger in oren ond the more dioerrified ty vnrieties, ond the other
molier ond eomparntinety hcmogeneone, the prearmption ie in sooner os tte
latter being derived from the forma, rather thnn the sumersrom the latter.
Το deduce the IndoEuropeenr of Europe from the Indo-Europeene etheit,
in ethnology, ie like deriving the reptiles ol Greet Britain hom those of
Ireland in erpetology.
