The connexion of the American with the Englishman is .

clear. Nearly as clear is that between the Englishman aud
the German. ln either case there has been a continuous
extension of the original population; and that within the
period of clear and authentia history.

But what if we found Englishmen in countries which uo
Englishman was known to have invaded? isolated English-
menl Englishmen cut off from the rest of their nation aud
languagel lu this ease we should have a truly ethnological
fact; since history, properly so called, would be silent.

0r what if we found apart from the other Germana, simi·
larly isolated populations, whose language was indeed German,
but of au uncertain affinity-conuected with the Dutch as
much as the English, the Norse as much as the Frisiau.

What if the language were lost, and nothing but similarity
of manners, or some vagae tradition connected them with tho
assumed parent stocki

The problem would become still more complicated.

Now such problems really exist. There are Goths beyond
the pale of England, Amerina, Germany, and Scandinavia.
They require notice.

1. Tlle Germanus cy the Vicentina- Two (perhaps more)
passages mention tho receptior, on the part of Theodoric the
OstroGoth of certain Alemannis armum, within the
boundaries of Italy. One is a letter of his own to Oloris :—
“ Motus vestros in fessas reliquias temperate: quia jure
gratia merentur evadere, quos ad parentum vestrorum msera
sionem respicitis consnyissc. Estote illis remissi, qui nostrie

fluidas celantur euterriti.''-Cassiod. Variar. ii. 41.

The other is from the Panegyric of Ennodius:-“Quid
quod a te Ahrnmnnioe penernlitas intro Italic terminos sine
detrimento Romanae possessionis inclusa estc oui evenit ha·
bere regem, postquam meruit perdidisse. Facta est Latiaris
castos imperii semper nostrorum populatione grassata. Oui
