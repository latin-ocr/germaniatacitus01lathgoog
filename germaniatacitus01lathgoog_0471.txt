ἣν αὐτοὶ ἐνῴιιοον, ἐσανγάιγῃ, ἐπέθεντο αὐτοῖς μὴ προσδεχο-

This, however, ean be reconeiled with previous passages, by
considering the Aeliae-os (or Gordiayar) ιο have been a free
company, reomiting itselt' on Slavonie ground, so much so
es to form the Germania· nucleus to what was really a Vandal
(or Slavonio) forae.

The Lacr-inge, mentioned else by Dion, may have been
similar adventurers.

Hence the names Geneerie, διο, are the names of Aeliayr
(or Gurdinyr); and the German blood amonget the Vandals
was limited to the ooynntio or rilreeost ol their German
leaders; and the Vandals are German only so far es they
are Astinge—whieh is only very partially.
