¹ Griaem tachow samosateni-The whole evidence ot' anti-
quity is ιο the abundant looks os the Germane, and ιο their yellow
hue From the customs of some of the Frisian or Norse popu-
lation, especially that oi the supposed Norae settlements of Mol-
querum and Hindelopen in Friesland, as they appear in the
twelith and thirteenth centurias, itis probably that this golden or
flaxen hue was artificially heightened, ι’.ι., by alkaline washes of
sodo or potash ley. The likelihood os this must be borne in
mind when we consider the extent ιο which the present prepon-
derance of dark or brown hair amongst many Germanic popula-
tions is reserable to a real change of colour 3 inasmuoh as it
possibly may be accounted ior by the disuse ol the babit of blanch-
ing it

In' all ethnological questions connected with the colour and
texture of the hair, the customs of the country, in respect to the
dressing ol it, should be carefnlly attended ιο. Thus amongst the
islandcrs os more than one part of the South Sea and Indian
Ocean, where the hair is naturally jot-blech, there is the practice
os reaching the head in ash, or lime-water-whioh gives it a red
tinge. Hair, thus discoloured, hae been described by excellent·
writers ns being ret

'l'he populetion whercin really, and naturally, rod hair prepon-
derotes,is not German, but Ugrian3 the Votialr, end other Finns
oi the Volgo, being pre-eminently πύῥροις and, Ι think it likely
that when we hear οἱ Germane being thus distinguished (te, as
red rather than yeltoro-haired), these allraline weshes may have
had something to do with the epithet. Such are common. Silius
Italicus calls the Batavian “rasore Batavus.''-iii. 608. ldore ex-
press still is the following extract from Galen ε-Οῧτως γοῦν τινὲς ’
ὀνομάζουσι roric Γερμανοὺς londonio, rol rot γε οὐκ ὄντος ξανθοὺς, ἐάν
α’κριέῶς τὶς ἐθέλοι καλεῖν, ullu πυῤῥοῦς.

‘'l'hat long hair was generally an honourable ornament, we infer
from its being amongst the Franks a sign os being afreernan5
whereas, to have the hair clipped, wasa degrading punishment. Ar
the sometime, as this very passage implies, the German modes οι

wearing it were serious. Herodian mentions the κουρά νῦν Γεμ-
μιινῶν (iv. 7); and Seneca the rufae crinis et οοοοιιιι in nodum oprad
Genaoaoa—De lra, c. 26.
