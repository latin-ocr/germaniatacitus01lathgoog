ferre impetus, disponere diem, vallare noctem, for·
tunam inter dubia, virtutem inter certa numerare:
quodque rarissimum, nec nisi ratione disciplinae con-

and others. whether, however, the real nature of the change has
been explained, or rather whether any change at all has taken place,
is uncertain. Assar as 1 can ascertain the views of the writers in
question, their opinion seems to be that those Hessiaue of Hesse who
coincided with the ancient Chatti, called timuelvcs by that name
(Chatti). If so, theold form has changed into the new one, and
the word which was now Hesre was once Claui, the change having
taken place on Hessian ground, and under the influence of time
