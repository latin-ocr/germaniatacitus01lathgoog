Ι will lay before the reader ell that can be said in favour of this view.

a. As admitted, the change from fr· ιο psr-is not of a common
kind.

means underralue the importance.

Now let us look ιο the assumptione requisito for this view.

In Juvenal the word occurs, throughout the MSS, as freneco.

In Tacitus it occurs seven times, and, throughout the MSS, as
sromeo.

Surely the lilrelihood of the M becoming NG, ae opposed to this,
is only a presumption against a fact.

But the first Roman writer who, by using the word, introduced
it into Rome, may hare written framea sor fronca, and so the error
have been propagated. This, Ι submit, is only walid against some-
thing else equally hypothetical. It is not enough ιο say that an
author may blunder. Is it were so, any men might believe or
disbelieve what he ohooscs. The particular likclihood cf each
blunder must bc shown.

Still the assumption may possibly be legitimatc ; since it is pos·
sible that the hypothesis, which arises out ct' them, may clear away
numerous and considerable difficulties, do away with numerous and
considerable improbabilities, and so gain credence on the strength os
the phenomcna lor which it will account.

Iret us see what is done in this way.

It does just the contrary to what it ought.

'l'he Franks, under the namo os Frank, appear in history, ior
the first time, in the soeood century—uc earlier.
