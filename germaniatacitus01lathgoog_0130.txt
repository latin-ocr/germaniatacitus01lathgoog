PROLEGOMENA. cxv

Mtiser has shown clearly that there is no ground whatever for
secking informatiou respectiug cur forefathers in the forests
of North America, or the islanda of the south Sea, aud yet
people seem at present again inclined to gc back tc their
notione. Idc not meanto say that the habitatione of the
ancient Germane were ¹the same in every respect as those
of the present time, for in winter, ey, they were, no doubt,
obliged tc have ligbts in the day-time, all the openings of
the house being closed with beardo, as they had uo glass
wiudcwa3 but this was the case in Rome itself; aud similar
houses still exist at Rome. Ι cannot, indeed, see why our
aucestors of the fourteenth century should have been much
more civilized thau they were in the time cf Augustus. Ma-
roboduus, however, seems to have had a kingdom which was
really iu a state of civilimticu, with feudal institutione which
had arisen out of his conquest of Bohemia; for that country
had helore been inhabited by Boiaus; that is, Kelts. Ti-
berius intended to attack him on two sides; he himself
assemhled his troops in Noricum and Vindelicis, and his
legate, Sentius Satuminus, was to advance from the Rhine
through the Hercyniau aud Thuringian forests. The Romans
made great preparatione, in constructing their reads through
Germauy. In this campaign we meet with the first traces
of the unhappy divisions which characterize the whole· his-
tory cf the Genusum the northern tribes would not assint
Maroboduus, because he had not assisted them; he had
allowed their power to be broken, so that, in fact, they
hardly could assist him; they also mistrusted him, because
they believed that it was his intention to make himself
master over them, as he had over the Marcomanni. *⁵ ¹* ⁵ ¹*
Maroboduus had done nothing during the insurrectiou oi
the Pannoniaus and Dalmatiaus, although he must have
known that preparatione had been making against him.
The whole of that part of Germany which lies between the
Elbo, the Rhine, and the Westerwald, recoguised the supre-
macy of Rome, aa early as the year 760, tha Chauci, and
other tribes on the coast cf East Friesland aud Oldenhurg,
were as much subjecte cf Rome aa the Bructeri and che-

rusci in Westphalia. Quintilius Varus, who was descended
