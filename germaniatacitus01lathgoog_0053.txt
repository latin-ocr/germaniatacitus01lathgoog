their way of denoting it was less precise than our own, and
not always expressed in the same terms.

Of the Ugrians they knew little. Nevertheless, Tacitus
and others distinguish between the Finns and the Gennans.

The Albaniana, l think, were distinguished from the Greeks
cladrim but from thenations on their northern frontier in-
distinctly. The term Illyrico comprises the Abarara, aad
something moro.

The Iberians were clearly distinguished from all other
stocks hut the Keltic-from that indistinctly.

Upon the whole, the ancients may be said to have ovar-
valued the difference between themselves end the other six
stooks, and to have oadarvamed the difference between the
other groups of Europe; and this is just what the Spaniards
and English did and do with the present American abori-
grues.

These observatione have been made upon the assumption
that the only point which required illustration was the extent
to which the encients and moderus differed in their views of
the some platomam en assumption which supposes that the
number of stoeks at the beginning of the historical period was
neither more nor less than it isat present, and thet their
mutual relations were the same. This, however, may not
have been the case. Stocks may have become extinct3 or,
instead of the broad and trenchant lines of demereation which
now separate the great groups from each other, there may
have been a series of imperceptihle transitione. In either of

· these cases it would be incorrect to say that the modern view

is more seientifie than the ancient. The latter, instead of
seeing the sanie things in a different light, may have seen a
different atate of things.
