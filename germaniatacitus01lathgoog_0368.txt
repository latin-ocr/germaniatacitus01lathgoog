ment, 1 must anticipata a part of my inquiry. Good writers
have identified tbose Gnddans with the Gemma Goths. As,
however, they by no means overlook the fact ol the Gnddons
being Lithuanic, they must suppose that the name was
retained from that of the earlier Goths subsequently replaced
by Lithuanians. ln which case, the never inhabitants,
instead of retaining the name which they brought with them
from their own country, took that of the older population.

Now even in its most moderate form, this assumption is
considerably opposed to the usual course of ethnologieal
changes, or rather the usual course of etlrnological changes is
opposed to it. Iu the first place, there are two cases of the
incorporated aud amalgamated aborigines of a country taking
tbe name ol their conquerors to one of the converse process.
Thus Franco takes its name from the German Franks, and
England from the German English, instead of the Franks
taking their name from the Gauls‚ or the Angles from the
Britons. Still the converse takes place sometimes; and, as if
for the sake of invalidating the very connexion in question,
one of the best instanees of it is supplied bytho very district
under consideration. As far as any change took place at all
in respect to the conquerors of the parts about the Lower
Vistula it was just the contrary tu the particular instance
assumed to be the general rule. The German Prussians of
Prussia did take the name of the aboriginal Pras.

Now if the name Panasion were adopted by the conquerors,
vvho vvere really Germane, from the conquered‚ bow unlikely
isit that the lower orders-the rural population of the agri·
cultural districts, pre-eminentlytenacious of nationality‚ who
were really Lithuaniaus, should adopt the name of any
previous Germane. In this respect, then, the assumption
that the term Greddon is procl ol the Gotloacs being German
Gotlls is faulty.

Again-that the term Gudulon comes from Golden—is
generally admitted. Even, as it is, the preservation of it
is remarkable. But it becomes doubly remarkable if we
assumes total change of population to have taken place
between the time of its first application and the present.
As it is-tbe population being supposed to have remained
