noras ou sacriora unu. 149

An additional raason lor believing that, in the eyes oia German,
the source oi the Scala uas the source cf the nata, is to be found iu
the name of the latter river itsels. Tho namo Elo=atcem the
Scandinaviau equivalent to the German Mass-a lact which shows
' either that the Frisiau cs the Lower Illbe was spoken in a form
approaohing the Norae, or elsa that tho Norae itself was then spoken
sartber southwards than afterwards -“Alta fluuius oritur in pra·
dictis Alpibus, perque medios Gothorum populos currit in Oceanum,
iudo et Gotheltu dicitur.''—De Sit. Daniae, c. 229. This applica to
the amau river Gotoels.

Now as the name was German, and aa it was giren by the popu-
lation oi the lower part of the river, it ir more likely that it was
extended upwards to a Gemma branch‚ like the Saule, thau to a
Slooona'c one, like that which rises in Bohcmia

As Tacitus is now beginning with tho Danube, up to which he
brings the Hermunduri, the source of the Elbo must be in themora
northern parts cf the area oi that population ; but as he also sopa-
rates the Hermunduri from the Suari, we must be carefirl against
carrying the fronticr too far in that directiou.
