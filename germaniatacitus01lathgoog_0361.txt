The three texts of Jornandes, Panlns Diaconos, and the
Traveller's Song, give ns the rough materiale for the criticisnr
of the traditione of the Gothic nation. Their historical and
ethnological valne is another question.

To begin with Jornandes. He quotes moro than cuc

. earlier than himself, ey, Dio, Dexippus, and Ablavius. For

contemporary events, any statement of any such writer is
raluable.

But what is the valne of such earlier writers, in respect
to the times anterior to their own! in respect to the archoe
ology, ethnology, or ordpicec ol the Gothic natione l

Many put this high; since the Germania of Tacitus eope

The following facts, however, subtract from their velue :—

o. Adaptations to the traditione of other natione (real or

their ecelesiastical and claseical learning are heterogeneouely
intermixed with the proper Gothic narratives.

ὂ. In the cese of Jornandes, numerous real or supposed
facts, relatiug to the Geta, are confused with those relating to
the Gothi.

These objections are of special applicatiou.. To which
must be added those which apply to tradition iu genereth
even in its most unexceptionahle form. Upon these, however,
the present is no place sor enlarging. The only question, at J
present, under notice, is the extent to which the miyrotrhnc,
which we find in the two Latin writers (for the Traveller's
Soug has but little in this way), rest upon true and genuine
tradition—true and genuine tradition being the transmission
of the account of an actual event from one generatiou to
another, by wnwritten communication.

For this. it is absolutely necessary that the event trane ³
