ln one point, however, the order is natural. It repre-
sents the relatioaelip, officim, or affiliatioc between the six

Some of the tongues just enumerated were redn'ccd to
waiting many centuries ago. ln this case we have specimena
of thern in an earlier stage ol their growth; the difference
between the older and the newer forms of speech being, in
many instances, sufficient to constitute a fresh lonpucye.

never been written at all, we haro a modern formos speech,
without any specimen ol it during its earlier growth. All

Eaplt'sl, the Dutch, or the Ilipla-German, may investigate
their parentage, and ask what they each were at some earlier
period of their respective historice.

The descent of the Swedish, Norwcgian‚ and Danish is
from a langnage somewhat difficolt to designate. Itis the
