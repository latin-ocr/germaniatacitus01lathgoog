Who, however, lay to the east, and who ιο the north, is a
difficolt questiou; and still more difficolt is it to say who
amongst the northern group, were on the east, and who on
the west.

Tho Signlooee os Ptolemy are the most decidedly north·
western, or Frisian; the Varini of Tacitus, the most decidedly
eastern, or Slavonio. And thie is as much cs it is sale ιο say.

It is moro important to consider the reasons for believing
the populations to the north-west of the Angli to have been
Frieloo, rather than Angle, Saxon, or Anglo-Saxon. Why,
in the face of the fect of the Nordalbingiane (or the popula-
tions rrortl os tle Ello) being called Saxona* in the ninth
century, suppose thern ιο have been Frieiane in the second!

Tho anewer to this is sketohed in the preceding §.

Holstein, when and how did the Frieiane displaoe thom

If Frieiane were the earliest, when did the Angles do sol

Now it must be admitted that there is some evidence in
favour of this latter alternative3 but evidence which is by no
means conclusive.

Alfred writes (Orosius, p. ιδ), respecting Other, that
“He eeglodo to ιωιῑι porte ιο men haet Renum. Se stent

He also writes, “Gomon hi (ie, the English) of prim lol-
oum ham strangestan Gennaniae, eaet of daucum, and of
Angla, and of Gratum. Of Geato fmman sindon Oootroore,
and Wiltsoetoo. Daet is seo ιεοᾶ se Wiht hrot ealond on
