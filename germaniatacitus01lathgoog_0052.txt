Resides the Classical and Gothic, thore are five other stooks
in Europe; or, changing the expression, the whole indigemus
population of Europe may be throwu into seven groups.
Three of these have already been mentioned-the Gothic, the
Sarmatian, the Classical.

The soartl, the Kellia, comprises the ancient Gauls of
Gallia, and the ancient Britons of England, as well os the
present Bretons of Brittany, Welsh of Wales‚ Manxmcn of
tha Isle of Man, and Gaels of Ireland and Scotlend.

The Ugriana‚ or Finns, make the fifth group; and a large
group it is. Besides which it is the only one common ιο

Hungary, however, the Finn population is of recent intro-
duction, the present Ugrian indigena being the Lapps‚ Fin-
landers, and Esthouiaus.

The Basques of the Pyrenees, the only remnants ol' the old
lberian population of Spain, form the aiath stook.

The Albaniana of Albania tho seoeatl.

The Turks of Torkey‚ and the Maltese, are not enumerated3
not being indigenous.

must not be surprised to lind it less scientific than our own.

0f the Olassioal stock they had a clear οοιίοος aia, they
put at its full value the differences between tho group to which
they themselves belonged, and the groups to which the so-
called Barbaricas belonged. But this notion was clear in
oue direction only. It only comprehended the points of
difference. The resemblances which brought the Slavonians
and Goths into the same group with themselves—tho group
called Indo-European—were unknown.

Between aGoth, a Kelt, and a Sarmatian, in their more
extreme forms, they also drew a clear distinction; although
