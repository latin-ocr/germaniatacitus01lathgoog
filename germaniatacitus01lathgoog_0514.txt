Usipetes, or Usiprii‚· a population which, unless Ptolemy
mention it under the name Vispi, he does not mention at all.

But Wis-baden is not too far south for the most southern
Uenuli. Perhaps not. We must remember, however, thet
they resch as far nortl as Holland, ic, the country cf the
Tubantes (Twmthc).-Epileyomeoo, § 1.

Tho Nov'oerree (Νούσιποι) of Strabo; known only as wc
know the Landi, ie, as members of the great Arminian con·
federacy, or, at least, as Germana, led in triumph for the
victory that avenged it.

Probably, Ustptii, under another form3 especially as the
Uatinii (as such) are not mentioned by Strabo.

2, 3. The other names ere more problematical.

Thus,-

Besides the Καθὺλκοι end Καοῦλκοι, Strabo mentions the
Chauci, distinguishing between them and the latter. Still the
names are alihe,-the more so when we find Chaucos made

Then there arethe Ohahilci of Gau-See not. in Germanic
omues.

alikc. Yet they both occur in the same writer-Strabo. ·

a. Are both, or either, Ampsiuarii?

b. Are both, or either, the people of the parts about
Kampten in Owen-ijsell

e. Is one one, end the other the other!
