alemant rs not so clear. Oonsidering the nature ol the Frisian
habitate, 1 believe it to represent the word rema-sed. This, however,
is but a guess.

The Frisian characteristic alluded ιο above' rs-

1. The great preponderanoe of compound words, ending in the
equivalent ιο ι1ιο English -Itarn, and German heim-eg„ Threehing-
lam, oppenheim.

2. l'he peculisr form this elementJtelres.

This is -um, the t being omitted, and the vowel being se

In Frieslowd itsell so abundent are these compounds os mm, that
two out of three (sixteen out os twenty-four) of the places noted in
the map within a few miles of Leeuwarden, end in that element. ⁴

Zeelonde-Here but lew words are compounded of the equivalent
to -lsom end -bet'm at all, perhaps none except the word Ritttem ,·
which is in 1 and e.

Thus we heve the two extremes; te.. the Frisian topography at
its menum in Friesland, and at its minimum in Zeeland.

Between these two extremes the following is the order oi transition.

(ivoningewe—Here the Frisian compound predominates, and that
with the Frisien form. ln the awondbsenaenc of Appingadsm only,
we have eightesn names in mm.

In Groningen, however, we find occasion to mention another
l'risian characteristic—the omission ol -ss and on at the end of
words. Hence, ell true Frisian compounds of -snan end in -sno, as
Hetteena and Helberts·ma‚· whilst the numerous words that, ina
sen-country, are componnded os -dom, tale such forms as the follow-
ing words in the arrocdsbsement of Winschoten—Holwier·do (not
dom), Utwierdo, to.

Now in Winschoten, although the Frisian characteristic of the
final -ο be carried to a great extent, the forms in -um are lew. ln
the next province-

Brenthe—they do not occurat all. But Drenthe, like Winschoten,
seems to be reclaimed land, and as such, the tactas of a population
less aboriginal than that of Friesland and Groningen.

obrepet-a. amusement os Zenone-Here we have three
compounds oi bos, oir.: Blanken-bom, Windesbeim, and wila-um
-all three different3 one Saxam one German, and one Frisian.
