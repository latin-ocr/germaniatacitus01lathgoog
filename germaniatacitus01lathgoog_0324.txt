since the languages were wholly unknown, and the evidence they
supplied unappreciated.

Hence the test was less refiued. As a consequence of this, what
we call Upi-ion was, in the time ot* Tacitus, partly Fica and partly
ditonico.

l. The first was the name where the physical conformation was
that of the lappae people ιο whom, at the present moment, the
term Fica is limited by the Scandinawians ol Norway and Swedsn.

2. 'l'he second was that where the physical conformation was not
much different from that os the Germane, and it comprised (probably
with many other sections) the Qcoeru or Finlanders—-whose bulk
and physical strength ie by no means, palpably and contrastedly‚
inferior to that of the Swedss, Russians, and Lithuanians. Of these
the Sitones (or Qvaens oi Finland) were the chief. Tacitus makes
them Sucvic ,· by susce probably (but not indisputably) meaning
Suionic.

Now the separation ol what we now called Ugrians into the
Sitonians and Finns is, in reality, the natural inferenoe from the
remarkable contrast between the Ugrians ol the Iapp type, and the
Ugrians of the Finlandic ; a difference which existe at the present

moment ss strongly as ever it could have done in the time of
Tacitus, a difference, too, which, ewen in the present days of ethno-
logical classification, has been often overwulued. Hence, the separa·
tion of the Sitones from the Fanni is no argument against the
former being Finlanders‚ aa, Quoerw, properly so called, Finns ol
Finland, imprcpsrly. It is just such a separation as many an
ethnologist would make now. 'l'he difference which it is most
important to remember is that between the words steu and Finn
os nomes—a differenoe which wc of England draw less definitely
than did Tacitus3 or, at least, Tacitus's informante.

⁴ Hellusios et caenosi-Upon the latter cl these names Ι can
throw but little light. On the former I can only remark the resem-

blance of their name to Ptolemy’s river acuum (Χαλοὺσος abrahoe)
and the Ohali (Xc'los).

But these are in the parts about the Lower Elbs, or the rivers of
Mechlenburg, cr the Eyder, or, perhaps, the Treta· to the last of
which the name Otclscsus has been supposed tc apply. still, they
may be the parts to which Tacitus refers; notwithstanding the fact
ol the Hellusii being mentioned along with the Sitones and Ficus
