Francoaia ue may simply suppose them to be Franks of
adifferent division of the Frank name.

All that follows from the proposed latitudo given to the
name Marcomanni, follows from the proposed latitudo given
to the name Frank.

Indead, if we look at their geographical distribution, we
shall lind that the Franks were the Marclmoa of the Roman*
frontier; and l submit to the reader the doctrine, that
they called themselves Franks because they were so, ia, in
opposition to their fellas-Germane, who were subject to
Roma.

A German of the Decumates agri was not a Frank (though
he might be an Akamas), because he was not really fres.

The Burgundios of the interior country was not a Fumat.
Really fres u‘e was; but as his freedorn was not contrasted
with the dependence of his neighbours‚ it aas not necessary
for him to call himself so.

What is gained by the hypothesis? To say nothing about
the minor migratione, it gete over (amongst others) the fol-
lowing great difficulty.

The Franks ol Franconia are Hiplr those of the Lower
libiae, Loto Germane.

Such the hypothesis.

Ι. Ta Franks os tls southern scantiae-Probus had to deal
with both Alemanni and Franks. lt is probalb that these
were the Franks of Franconia.

The Franks whom Aurelian chastised‚ wera certainly so;
and, upon the whole, 1 think it is these Franconian Franks
(the Franks of the Upper Rhine) who appear earliest
in history. Even if they do not, they appear far too soon
to have the name accounted lor by any conquesta or migra·
tions; moraments either way, from the Upper to tha horror,
or from the Lower to the Upper Ruina, involving equally
great, though different difficulties.

The measure of the southern, or Franconian Frank con-
quest, is to be found in the name Francia-Gom& this being
to them as Alsatia is to the Alcmenae-suevicae, and Bur-
gundy to the Burgundians.
