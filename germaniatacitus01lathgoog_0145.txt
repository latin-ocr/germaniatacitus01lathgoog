The German term Bartsch isan adjective ,· the earlier formos the
word' being dimise. Here the -isc is the same as the -s'sd in words
like sels-rili. Dicat, on the other hand, means pcople, or notiora
Hence, dimoc is tc dior, as popularisis to populus. This adjective
was first applied to the laaqreaqe,· aud serwed ιο distinguish the
populor, οοιὶοοαῑ, notice, or vulgar tongue of the populations to
which it belonged from the Iatiu. It lirst appears in documenta of
the ninth century, “Ut quilibet episcopus homilias aperte trans-

ferre studeat in rusticam Romanam linguam aut ιιοοιίοσοοι, quo ¹
taudem cuncti possint intelligere quae dicantur.''-Synodus Tu· χ

nonensis, nn. 813. ,

As to the different forms in which either the root or the adjective
appears, the most important os them are as follows :- ἵ

1. In Moeso-Gothic, piudnkd = idcirce-Galaticus ii. 143 a
form which implies the substantive piuda=idroc.

2. ln Old High German, diot=p0pulue, gives the adjective diut-
iac=poputcria

3. ln AngloSaxon we have perid and prodire.

Sometimes this adjective means arram ,· in which case it applies
to religion and is opposed tc Uindelicos.

Ostener it means intellrgihle, cr ommcular, and applies to lan-
guag03 in which caso it is opposed to Latin.

The particular Gothic dialect to which ic* was first applied, was
the German of the Middle Rhine. Here the forms are rancus :-
theodiacc, thiudisca, theudisca, teudisca, teutisca. When we reach
parts less in contact with the Latin lauguage ol Rome, its use is
rarer. Even the Germano of the Rhiire frequently use the equi·
valent term Alermnnic, and Francia, whilst the Saxone and
Scandiuavians never seem to have recognized the word at all.

Hence it is only the Germane os danway that are Ilicet-ieci, or
Decet-sede.

H We pli England, on the other hand, apply it only to the Dect-cle of
ollan .

Hitherto the term is, toa certain degree, one ol disparagement ς
meaning aon-noman, or culpor. lt soon, however, changes its

character ,· and in an Old High German gloss-armadiuti (occiderat) ’
