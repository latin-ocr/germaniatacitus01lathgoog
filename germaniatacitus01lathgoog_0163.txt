Far too many inquirere either adopt cr acquiesce in the current
noticn that moratam are phencmena‚ which ve may assume ιο any
extent required, not only cn account cf the facts demanding explana·
tion, but in order to sustain the accuracy of even indifferent authors.
To such, it is as easy to bringa population from the Baltic to the
Mediterranean, across a whole series cf hostile countries, as to move
a knight across a cheae-board. The great name of Niebuhr justifies
this gmtuitous prodigality of locomotion. Nay more, it seems so
philosophie to trace a so-called national movement ιο its primary
cause, that a known invasion in one quarter is often supposed to
justify the assumption ol an unknown one elsewhere-sc that
nations prees each other forwerda themselves being pressed upon.
This doctrine, with metaphors and illustratione to match, is plausible
enough to be widely recognised.

It means, in its nalsed form, that s attacks a, because he cannot
support himself against o, c being similarly situated in respect to
mand so on 3 aview which makes the great qualification for the
attach of another nation’s country, the inability to defend one's
own.

This doctrine we would gladly believe ιο be true. It would
diminish by nine-tenths the crimes of the warlilse pert of the human
species. It would reduce all but the first primary movements toa
matter cf necessity, and so justify them. The motivas for aggres-
sicn would not be envy, cruelty, and cupidity‚ but the unpleasant
necessity oi choosing between reparation for what has been lost to
yourself by the appropriation cf what belongs to another, and death
or bondage.

A little analysis, and a few distinctions, will show that, instead cf
migratione being thus common, they are eminently rare.

Amiyratt‘oct is different from amere extension of frontier. No
one says, that when the whole American population presses vvest-
wards, at the rate cf (say) tvelve miles a year, there is a migraticn.
The frontier has been advanced 3 the advancing population being

continuom with the stationary, and no separationes one portion oi
the American population from another having taken place. The
Russians are gradually encrcaching upon the Siberians 3 and the ,
English on the Welsh 3 yet none of these sreinstances of migration.

A mtyrotion is different homa return, or remigraticn. No
