burg-Thorpe's note on the Travellcr's Song in the Oodav
Econiecsia.

Teutam-In the way of evidence of there being Teutones
amongst the Germane, over and above the associate mention l
of their names with that ol the Oimbri, there is but little. ,
They are not so mentioned either by Tacitus or Strabo. Ι
Ptolemy, however, mentions a) the Teutonarii, b) the Teutones:
Τευτονοάριοι καὶ Οὐίρουνοι-Φαραδεινῶν δὲ καὶ Συήέων,
Τεύτονες καὶ Ἄμαρποι. Besides this, however, arguments
have been taken from a) the meaning of the rout oat=paople
(blnda, Moeso-Gothic; bedd, Anglo-Saxon; dict, Old High
German: b) the soltus Teutoburgium o) the supposed con-
nection of the present word Dent-scl=Gernroa with the
classical word Teutones. These may brielly be disposcd of.

o.) Itis not unlikely for an invading nation to call them·
solves tle aalma, tle notione, tle proptu &c Neither, if the
tribe in question had done so (presuming them to have been
Germane or Gotho), would the word employed be very unlike
Tanton-oe. Although the word ploti-nnana or pooplo, is
generally strong in its deelension (so making the plural bind-
ὅσ), itis found also in a weak form with its plural ilict-rto:
Τηίων. Sec Deutsche Grammatik, i. 630.

d.) The soltus Tentoberyios mentioned by Tacitus (Anu. i.
60) can scarcely have taken its name from ‘a tribe, or, on the
other hand, have given it to one. It means either rto till of
tlte peopla or tle city os tle μορίω according as the syllable
derg- ie derived from bdlrys=a llll, or from dorirye=c city.
ln either case the compound is allowable, ag. dict-wic, pollio
