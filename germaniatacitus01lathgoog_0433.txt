Neither must it be too large; inasmuch as room must be
left for the equally important divisione of the burgundians,
during the later, and for the Goths ol the Danube, the Thn-
augiensem the 0111111, in the earlier, period of their history.

Modern &colia comes under this category; so that modern
Suedio may be considered as the carbas ol the Alemanno-
Suew'e confederation.

That active emperor, Probus, coerced the Alemanni; he
coerced them and something more. He recovered the whole
country of Saabia, and ia said to have reestablished the limes.

But from the time of Probus downwards, the Alamanno-
Suevie encroachments steadily progressed. Before aa. 300,
they had become the enecators ol the present Germana of
Switzerland; and, by 1111. 400, those of the Alsatians aad
Bavarians.

Such was their time and scene. Strongly contrasted with
the (111111, they advanced their frontier gradually and coa-
tiouously; aud the effect of this is, that one half of what at

present constitutes 1111 High-German division, is of Alemanno- =

Suevic origin.

In individual heroes this division is poor; none of ita
kings or generals having the prominence of an Alaric, ,a
Theodoric‚ a Gundebald, 111011111.

Putting together what has been said about the names
Alemanni and Saevi, it is ι11111111111111111111,11 tho two chief
membcrs of this alliance, those whose name was Gennan
were (leals (the 1111111111), and those whose name was Gallio
(0111101111 0111111111. This, however, is a forcible way ol*
puttiog au apparent objection, rather than an objectiou itscll'.

If the Alemanni, originally, were not German, their
nationality and characteristica must have merged into that
of the Suevi early.

Believiug the Vandal to have been Slavonio, the Alemanni
(supposing al- to mean olii) would be in the same relation to
the Saevi 11 the former were to the Goths.

Itis not superfluous to remark‚that the Alemanni and Alani
are undoubtedly confused by more thau one ancient writer,—
a pregnaut source of difficulty, which it is not necessary at
present to enlarge on.
