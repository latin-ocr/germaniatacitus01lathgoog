Tbese countries have never been known to beurere German
than at present, and at present they are Slevonic. At the
same time, Ι believe that there are traditione among the pre·
sent Tshekhs‚ which refer to their conquest of the country and
the usurpation of their ancestors. The velue of these depeuds
upon their nationality. This may be absolute. It may, on
tha other hand, be of the same velue as the traditious about
Brut being the patriarch of the Britoua or, in other words,
the legend may be more due to the induence of a medieval
Latin literature, than the truly native traditione.

Having thus enumerated the countries which were as much
(or more) Slavonio a thousand years ago as they are now, Ι
subjoiu some of the chief extracta that prove their having been
so—all of them being taken from Zanes, and those only being
selected which the date accompanies, and where there is,
besides this, the special statement that the population in ques-
tion was Slavonic.

The latest notiees come first. They are chiefly from Adam
of Bremen and Helmoldus, and epply to the Slavoniane of
the northern srontier.
