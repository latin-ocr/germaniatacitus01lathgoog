7 Treviri]—-'l'he lower third ol the Moselle may be taken as the
area ol the ‘l'reriri3 extending (there or thereabouts) from Treres
(A agusto Trevirorum) to (loblantz (Confluentes).

The chief natione with which they were conterminans on the
side ol Gaul were the Condrusi, Eburones, and Remi-all Brlpoe.

ule Treviri, like the Tencteri, were pre-eminently strong in
cavalry—Oresa, Bell. Gall. ii. 24, v. 3.

They were also but slowly conquered.-“ Treviri liberi antea,” dre.
-Plin ir. 17.

The name Treviri is most probably Gallio. The Tre, is the Tre
in such words as Tre-casses in ancient Gaul, end Trcgoeeell in Gorn-
wall 3 the Keltic amplae, a root exceedingly common in Keltic
geographical terme. 'Phe constitution was ealle, the Condrusi and
Eburones being cibalas of the Treuiri

The language ol the Tre-oiri is important.

In most esses it would be hypercritical to suppose that there
was any differenoe between the languege ol the town of Tretos and
the languege of the Treuiri In the present question, however, itis
not so. 'Phe area under consideration is the area ol' cithera mixed

Now St. Jerome has the following passage (Prolegomen. lib. ii. ad
Epist. ad Galat.)-“ Unum est quod inserimus et promissum in
exordio reddimus, (dabas excepto sermone Graeco, quo omnis Oriens
loquitur, propriam linguam eandem pene habere quam Treviri, nee
referre si aliqua exinde corruperint3 quum et afri Phoenicum lin-
guam nonnulla ex parte mutaverint 3 et ipsa Latinitas et regionibus
quotidie mutetur et tempore.'’

Ithink that this langnage was that ol the Tolostobois', Proceri, and
Tectosagos, ia, of those Galate who gave their name to Galatia

Niebuhr, however, denies that it was Galatiae that Seserem
heard; end, alter noticing the campaign of the Romans against
them, he adds in a note that “St. Jerome says that he heard

the same language in Phrygia es at Tretos, but this cannot be
referred to the Galatians, and St. J erome probably saw Germane who
had settled in Phrygia at different times, especially Gotho, in the
