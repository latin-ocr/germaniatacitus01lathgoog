xc THE GERMANY OF TAGITUS.

instance Gaul, subsequently Spain, finally Aliica; their poli-
tical relations being with the Saevi, Alemanni, Burgundians,
and the southern Franks. Their ancestors were some of the
Suevi of Tacitus, more especially the Semnones; their de-
scendants the present Sorbs of Saxony and Silesia.

The statement of Idatius in (lhrouicon Roncallense is,
that the Vandals of Spain (dodel-usian Spain more particu-
larly) were Wuodah‘ Silingi. These are admitted by Zeuss
to have been the Echryyee of Ptolemy3 as well as bo have
been the occupante of parts so near Silesia aa Upper Lusatia

p. 445).

( Again, the pagate Silensis is admitted to be a Latin form
of the Slavonie llos-ane aud Stoma-ane, the older forms
of the present German Gallesion, and English Sil-esis

Yet the similarity between all these forms, and the
name Σίλιγνγ-αι (applied to the same locality) is cot ad-
mitted.

Admitting it myself‚ l consider the' Vandals of hadal-asia,
the Vandals of Geuseric, and the Vandals of Gelimer to
have been no Germane, but Slavonian Sorba, chiefly from
Saxouy, but in some cases from parts so far east as Si·
less‘o, in which country, the Vandals of the south-western
frontier may have come in eontact with those of the south-
eastern.

This shows that the separation between the two branehes
of the Wandals must not be carried too far; indeed we
areat liberty to take Silesia as a centrel point, and look
upon the movements of the Vandals, whose alliauce was with
the Goths, aud the Vandals, whose alliauce was with the
Alemanni, as blows against the majesty of Rome struck right
and left by the same people.

At any rate, the Germanic leaders of each belonged to one
and the same coguatio of sibsoeofi,· the Vandal equivalent to
the Balt-oogs of the visi-goths, aud the Amal-coya of the
Ostro-goths, being the Ast-iuga, a name which we have in
two formaene Moeso-Gothic, audone Old High German.
