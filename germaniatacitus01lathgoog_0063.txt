ι dentelly. It may eafely be said, that if this has happened at

all, it has happe'ned against great odda.

Yet the solution is obscure; we cannot well suppose the
- Geato· ιο bave migrated from the land of the Germ whilst
the notiou that the aare came hum the Gelli, isset asida by

the greater antiqnity of the former name (Geta).
'¹ ls there any other explanation?

In what may be called the Getic hypothesis, it isheld that
the Geths were Geta, and the Getes Gotbe, from tle he-
gieoiop,· in other words, the second of the maamad lacte is
denied, oia, the origin of the Gotho in Germany, and the mi·
gratian from that country. There was no migretiou at all. The
Goths were on the Lower Danube from the beginning, and they
were known to the earlier Greek and Latin writers as Getae.

Such the doctrine. Now, aa there is the evidence ol more
than one good writer of antiquity‚ aa to the Thracians being in
the seme category with the Geta, the Thracians must have
been Gothic as well. Hence the questions involved in the
hypothesis in question are ot' considerable magnitude.

Such is the point of view from which the views developed
in Grimm's History ol' the German Language‚ must be
scen in the first instance. The details by which it is sup·
ported are elaborate, but eminently unsatisfactory. Reasons
for thinking them nenecessary are given in the sequel,¹ where
the difficulty arising from the similarity of name is admitted,
but differently explained.
