of classes. We may even admit the consideration ο1 certain
external circumstances, such as literary development, and
political separation. This makes the arrangement more or
less artificial.

Be this, however, as it may, the following is a classi-
fication of the kind in question.

a. The Danish‚ Swedish, and Norwegian dialecto (written
and nnwritten)‚ the Faroic and the Icelandic, form the
Scandinavian branch of the Gothic stock.

ὂ. The Frisian, Old-Senon, Anglo·Saxon, English, Low-
land Seotch‚ Dutch ο1 Holland‚ Platt·Dentscb, end High
German, form the Teutonic branch ο1 the same.

0f course these again 1111 into subdivisione, according to
the date of the specimen, ay, there is the Old Frisian,
Middle Frisian, and New Frisianr Semi-Saxon, Old English,
Middle English, and Modern English; the Moeso-Gothic,
Alemannic, &c

The disadvantags of this method is that, in attempting
to draw definite lines of demarcation between the different

divisione, it disturbs the history of the langnngm, and dis·
guises the order ol' their evolution. Thus the Frisien, a
member ο1 the Teutonic branch, is undoubtedly more like
certain Scandinavian dialects than it is to the more extreme
members of its own division.

Such being the case, afresh view is required, and this is

best given by placing the tongues in a linear series according
to their affinities, and treating them as 11 (as ie really the
case) they passed into each other by insensible degrees.

Hence, the more convenient, as well as the more natural
series, is that of the first chapter, oia.

' 1. Norse. 2. Frisian. 3. Old Senon. 1. Anglo-Saxon.

5, 6. Platt·Dentech and the Dutch of Holland. 7. High
Garnran. 8. Misso-Gothic.

The general characteristica of these divisions and subdivi-
sione of the Gothic tongues, in respect to the differences of
their systems of elementary sounds, their grammatical struc-
ture, and their vocabularies, are in thc department of philology.
One or two isolated points, however, have a practical bearing
upon certain otbnologioal details.
