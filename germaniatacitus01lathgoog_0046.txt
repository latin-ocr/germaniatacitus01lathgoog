supposing them to have been thus exceptioual ιο their country·
men, they may be considered as the only Germane of whose
existence in the time of Tacitus we are sure.

Ιι was as little ior the want ol actual wars and migratione
as for the paucity of hostile neighbours, that thess exceptional
Germane of the Danube are found, in the fourth, fifth, sixth,
seventb, and eighth centurias, in the locality assigned ιο them
by Tacitus in the second.

There was much of each. This we triow to have been
the case. Of similar wars aud similar migratione, on the
Oder and Vistula, we know nothiug; we only assume them
lor the sake of accounting for a supposed change of popula-
tion.

Now it is certainly uuscientifio ιο attribute so much, in
the way ol displacement, ιο the ware and migrations ol which
we know nothing, when those which we do know are known

Middle Danube, what is it that we find in the time of
Tacitus? Romans, Germane, Slavonians, all on the Rhatian
and Pannonian frontier, the Romans having the lion's share
ol country. What in the time of Theoderici Germane,
Romans, ond Slavonians, the Germane possessiug much of
what the Romans had lost. This is what wo see ou the
points illuminated by the clear light of history, and thc
changes implied are but moderate. In the parts beyond,
however, everything increases its dimensione. The ware are
more exterminating, and the migetions longer, the displace-
ments greater than anything known elsewhere. Is this the
view which we get from that cautious induction which measures
the unknown hythe known, or is it a mere sketch of the
imagination, where all things show lorger in the twilight‚ and
where anything may be assumed, because, though there is
nothing to support an hypothesis, there is nothing to con·
