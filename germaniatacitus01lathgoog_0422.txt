ment, Ι must anticipato a part of my inquiry. Good writers
hare identified those Guddoas with the Gortuae Goths. As,
however, they by no means overlook the fact of the (iuddons
being Lithuanic‚ they must suppose that the name was
retained from that of the earlier Goths subsequently replaced
by Lithnanians. In which case, the newer inhabitants,
instead of retaining the name which they brought with them
from their own country, took that of the older population.

Now even in its most moderate form, this assumption is
considerably opposed to the usual course of ethnological
changes, or rather the usual course of ethnological changes is
opposed to it. In the first place, there aro two cases of the
incorporated and amalgamated aborigines of a country taking
the name of their conquerors ιο one of the converse process.
Thus Franco takes its neme from the German Franks, end
England from the German English, instead of the Franks
taking their name from the Gauls, or tbe Angles from the
Britons. Still the converse takes place sometimes; and, as if
for the sake of invalidating the very connexion in question,
one of the best instances of it is supplied by the very district
under consideration. As far as any change took place at all
in respect ιο tho conquerors of the parts about the Lower
Vistula it was just the contrary ιο the particular instance
assumed ιο be the general rule. The German Prussians of
Prussia did take the name of the aboriginal Pras.

Now if the name Praeclare were adopted by the conquerors,
who were really Germane, from the conquered‚ how unlikely
isit that the lower orders-the rural population of the agri-
cultural districts, pro-eminently tenacious of nationality, who
were really Lithueniens, should adopt the name of any
previous Germana. In this respect, then, the assumption
that the term (ἴοιίάοο is proof of the Gutlloaes being German
Gotls is faulty.

Again-that the term Guddoa comes from Gothori—is
generally admitted. Evcn, as it is, the preservation of it
is remarkable. But it becomes doubly remarkable it we
assumea total change of population ιο have taken place
between the time of its first application and the present.
As it is-the population hcing supposed ιο have remained
