words, Ι believe the name to be notive in one of the two cases
only; so that the Goth-ini were Ge only iu the eyes of
their Slavonio neighbours, just asa Peloponuesian was a Greek
in the eyes of aRoman only; whereas the Gethonea (Querar,
hc.) were Gt iu the eyes of their Slavonio neighbours and
themselves as well, even as the Γξαῒκος of Epirus was doubly

Greek; Greek when he spoke of himself, aud Greek when
he was spoken of by a Roman.

o. There is no evidence ol the numerous Lithuanic popula·
tiens ever having had a collective or peierat name of their
own, however much they may have had one given them by their
Slevonie neighbours; in both of these respects being exaotly
in the same case aethe Germane.

h. For the spem'flo name ofa particular Lithoanian popula-
tion (ie, for a name equivalent to Chatti, Olemuci, of similar
divisione os the Gonnoi), the term Gethones (Gothis, Gut-
tones, he), is extended from Gallicis to Gourlaud‚ is of im-
probable (1 do not say impossible), extent. No single aeolica
of a populonien is likely to have had so large an area.

o. The difference between the name of the people (Gotlini),
und their language (Gallica), suggests the likelihood of the
nutius of the eortius? having been some form of eac
(Hac, bru). In England, iu the sixteenthand seventeenth
centense, the generality of writers spoke of the people of
Germauy as Germane,- bnt of the language, as Dutch, High
Dutch, or Low Dutch, aethe case might be. Hence, we heard
of translations from tle Hithutolr, even though the people
who spoke it were called Germane.

Now I consider tbut the same Slevonians who spoke of
the people of Gallicia as Gotline' (a presumed Slavouic form),
were also those who spoke of their language as Gallio (a pre-
sumed notive form), even ns one and the same populatiou (the
English) spoke of the Dutch tongue and the Gernsun people.

And Ι also consider that those same Slavonians called the
language of the Gothini Gallio, because Gallio was the
natiue name of it 3 just as the fuet of Dutch being the native

nume ol the German, accounts for the terms Iligh Dutch and
Low Dutch.
