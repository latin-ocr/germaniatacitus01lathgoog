Zeus compares this with the Noree rde=bpdpor=mce
(the sume word).

Agminst it are—

o. The utter absence oi any such name applied to any
portion οι· the Norseurcn in any of the numerous Norse
writiuge

d. Its present power, es the neme ol' eo large a country as
Bessis, withso lew definite traces of Norsc oerupuucy.

c. The nume Rhoxolani, oi a untion between the Dou oud
Duieper.

The following view is considered ιο reconcile these diffi-
culties.

Previons to the descent ou the Euxine und Caspium, the
Norseuren conquered oud occupied the country oi thc Iller-
lom, oud, alter they hed become known ιο their neighbours
ss Rhoe, haressed the eastern empire.

In being known ιο their neighbours hythe nume of the
country they occupied they were like the present Spaniards
of Mexico. =
The question as to the etoek ιο which those Rhoe-lani
belonged, will bring with it s fect confirmatory of the prc-
vions view. Although we nowhere find that the Norscmen

in question thorosolcee colkd tlenseoloer Bos, the Finlanders nt
the present moment call them Broc-alsium. and their country

Ru'i'iiid is ο fect which hus long been known. It hus also

long been known thet -loincn is the regular Finlundic ter-
minetion for gentile nouus. Such being the cese, the word
Ῥωξολανοί has long been looked on us ο genuine Upi-ion
gloss; aud es Strabo mentions the Βιοοοῑοοί, there must

. have been, iu his time, not ouly Ugricns iu Russie, but
Ugriens so nenr the Euxine cs lor words of their tongue to
resch his informante.

Such Ι believe to heve been the case. Ι think that there
were Ugrions as ier south es the Lower Danube. This con-
firms the notiou that Russie was not originally Slevonic.*
Ιι οΙοο confirms the notion that there were Ugriens iu South
Europe before tho Majiar invasion.
