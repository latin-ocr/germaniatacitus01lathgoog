artemonem. cxxxiii

Pliny. Their looality is now under water; being, probably,
the bottom of the Zuyder-Zee.

l. Sturii, seems a true proper name.

2. Marsaci, ie, probably, a derivative from the root Marad
:uiaret-mer.

3. The Prista-borres, I think, is vassa-sam (Frisios
Fen), a real name in more than one Frisian locality at the
present moment.

As the result of a pieoe of guess-work, I believe that the
-v-u, in the unsatisfactory terme Ist-ae·oora-esand lng·ae·oors-es,
is simply esen=saa,· and the division is much more local
than commentatore imagine. Hence—

l. The Herminones meant the people of the Upper Eme,
and water-ehad between that river and the Weser.

2. The Ingaevones, the Fen-people in frent of it, and-

3. The Istaevones, the people of a Karteron, whatever
the impert of that name may have been.

If so, the informante of the Romane, who first circulated
the terme, wera in a predicament different only in degree

from that of a writer about England, who at Grimsby or
Boston, had heard that the whole scanty was divided into
Lindsey, Helland, and Krete-eeu, and applied his information
to the British empire at large.

ὃ LIX. THE PARMAEGAMPI, ANB anauamcfflm.

Power of the root, c-rup, uncertain. See not. in v.
Chamavi.

But, in eripio, probably, German.

To what languages, the first elements (Parm- and Adrab)
are referable, is uncertain; the displacements here having
been great.

a. It may have been some Slavonie dialect, the population
being a western continuation of the Saxon and Bohemian
Slaves.

b. lt may have been Boian (sla, Gallie or Keltie).

See nn. in vv. Boicmum and Nariscc‘.
