It is not impossible that the lirst two Ambrones may be the
same people, im, loth Saxone of Britain, rather than British
Saxone, in the first case, and German Saxons (as the true Old
Saxons were) in the second3 since there ie some difficulty in
believing an archbishop of York to have been employed so
lar from his diocese as Westphalia, and a Welsh monk
recording his operatione-Since

α. There may have been certain Old Saxone in Britain;
just as there were certain Frisians.

ll. Old Saxon might, to a Briton like Nennius, have been
equivalent to paguo Saron, since one of the first dnties of
the Ohristiauized Anglo-Saxons of England was to convert
the Old Saxone of the Continent, as is narrated fully by Beda.
Hence, the distinction between Pagan and Christian nearly

This makes it look as if the Ligurian Ambrones were such
formidable robbers as to have made their name synonymous

that they called themselves what Festus says their neighhonrs
called thern, uua osu bau lise.

The word lelrc has thus been enlarged upon, because it
has been put forth as an clement in the doctrine of the
German origin of the (limbri and Teutones; to which bas

Ambrones were part and parcel of the socelled Germana of
the Pennino Alps-See §i noto 3.
