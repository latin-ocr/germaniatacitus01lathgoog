Nor Keltia or Gallie, like a Gaul from the parts about
Marseilles.

Nor yet Iberia, like a Spaniard.

Nevertheless, he was referable to some great class.

ln many cases I believe this class to have been deemed
Gomon, purely on some such negative trains of reasoning
ae the preceding; for instance :-I imagine that certain
differentis between tho Bastarnae on one side, and the Sar-
matians, Thracians, Galate, and Illyrians on the other, made
them pass as Germane, in the eyes of such iuquiring but
imperfectly informed Greeks, as knew that there was an
ethnologieal class called German, without knowing accurately
what it was. Such a process, mutatis metandis, is by no
means uncommon, even in modern investigatione. Ethnology,
even in the hands of Pricbard, has its class called Alloplyliaa,
the contente being whatever is, at one and the sama time,
European or Asiatic without being what is called Indo·
European.

It is nofe, too, to say that the Greeks were such authorities
in the eyes of a Roman, that, except where their errore wera
palpable, they were rarely contradicted. Something of this
sort is to be found in tho intellectual relations between
England and Germany at the present moment. How many
points are there in such a question, as (ay.) the ethnology of
British India, where the English inquiret, although trusting
to himself for particulare lying within the pale of a well·
known area, puts his saith in soma German for the more
general questions that arise, as well as for those results in
which book-learning and speculation take a part? And
how often is he wrong in doing so?

According to this view, both the Greek and the Roman
evidence respecting Germany fall into two parts :—

1. The Greeks—

a. Whero they followed thc Romans, the only first-hand
inquirere, are accurate and truetworthy. But then their
evidence is osten either superfluous, or else only confirmatory
of what we learn from Oaesar and Tacitus.

b. Where their information is not of Roman origin, they are
indistinct and inaccurate-indistinet and inaccurate, for the
