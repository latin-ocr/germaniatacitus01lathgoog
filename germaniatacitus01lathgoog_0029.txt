thie the case in ethuologyt No. The Russian langnage,
although northern in locality‚ is southern instructore, being
more alriu to the Servian, with which it is aot iu contact,
than the Polish with which it io. Nay‚ more, the older
the specimens of the langnage the more it approaches the
Old Choreb-langnage, or the Old Slavonic.

This is hy uo means au irrelevant question even in German
ethnology. For that of southern Europe and Asia it is all-
important.

The greater the area we give to the Gemens of Tacitus,
the less room we leave for the numerous Sarmatian popula-
tions now in existence; and the lese room we leave for these,
the greater the difficulty of accouuting for their wide diffusion.

By supposing‚ however, that they originated iu so large
a country as Russia we meet this difficulty, since we thereby
allow ourselves a vast tract of laud to draw upon for the
several migratione necessary to account for the present
presence of Poles in' Poland‚ Serbs in Silesia, Tshelrs in
Bohemia, Slovalre iu Huugary, and (larinthians, Oroatians‚
and Dalmatiam, elsewhere.

But what if the internal evidence derived from the paucity
of Russian dialects, or (ohauging the expression) the uni·
formity of that tongue over a vast area indicate—ae such
phenomena do indicate-a recent introduction anda rapid
diffusioni ln this case, the difficulty remains as before,
aud wo must not only exclude a great number of Slavouians
from the countries of the west, but from the valley of the
Dnieper aleo.

Now, from all thatI collect from the langnage of the
best Slavonic scholare, the Russian tongue iu Russia seems
full as newas the Anglo-Saxou isin England3 in other words,
its dialects are lever and less marked than those of the
English of Great Britain.

On the other haud, it is in the south and west that such
differenoes are the most marked aud the most numerous.
