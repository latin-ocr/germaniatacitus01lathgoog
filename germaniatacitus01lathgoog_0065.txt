also believing that, next ιο the Gauls, the Gemens them-
selves supplied the Βοωοοο with informatiou concaming
Germany,l consider it more likely that one of the two
should be German and native, than that either the Germane
or the Gauls should have used two synonymous designatione.

4. When the name of the nation is the sameas that of
some natioual hero-Thus, the fact that the Greeks recog-
nized Hellen as the patriarch of their stock would, even if it
stood alone, be good reason for considering the name Hellenas

ιο be indigenous.
’ 5. When the name contains a sound found iu the lauguage
ιο which it applicabat not found in the langnage of the
most likely informante—Ep, I believe the word Thala ιο

it contains the Neres sound of b (th), a sound too rare to be
supposed ιο have come from another lauguuge.

6. When the name is very particular and marafin-The
names that one nation gives another are mostly paterio and
collectiva. They have seldom a vocabulary sufficiently full
for the divisious and subdivisione of any family but their
own. On the other hand, a very generis and collective
power is prima socia evidence of the name to which it is
attached not being native.

Writers, from whom it is uusafe ιο differ—as far as they
go on any principles at all, and exercise any doubt whatever
upon the subject—will possibly add another characteristic of
indigenous use. They may consider that the general and
undoubted vernacular use of a given name at one period may
be a conclusive argument iu favour of its remacular nse
originally. The natural reluctancc ofa whole nation ιο take
ιο itself a designation given ic by another, may be urged in
favour 'of this view. I submit, that this is entirely a ques-
tion of degree; and that it depende on the relative influence
and importunae of the two nations involved. The modern
name Bobium is, undoubtedly, anything bnt native, ia, ia
its immediate applicatiou. lt is a Roman word, in a Roman
form, and all that can be said in favour of its Belgic character
ie, that the country to which it applica supplied the Latin
language with the most essential part of it. Nevertheless, it
