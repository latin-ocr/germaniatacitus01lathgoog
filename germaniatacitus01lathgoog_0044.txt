waut in the way of vestiges, fragments, and effecte of the
antecedent uon-Slavonic aborigines. Be it so. Still the time
is short. Bohemia—as we bave seen—appears as an exclu-
sively Slavonic country as earlyas an. 625. Is the differ-
ences between these areas and the time of Tacitus suffi-
cient?

Undonbtedlya great deal in the way of migration aad
displacement may be done in five hundred years, aad still
more in seven hundred ; yet it may be salely said that, under
no circumstances whatever, within the historieal period, has
any known migration equalled the rapidity and magnitude of
the one assumed, and that under ne circumstances has the
obliteration of all signs of an earlier population been so
complete.

How could the displacement inlerred from this utter obliter-
ation, have taken placet Was it by a process of ejection, so
that the presumed immigrant Slaaouiaas conquerad and ex·
pelled the original Gotho? The chauces of war, when we get
to the historieal period, run the other way; aad the lirst
fact which we know concerning those sslf-same stammana,
who are supposed to have disposscssed the Germane in the
third and fourth centurias, is that, in the ninth, the Germana
dispossessed them. But, perhaps, the Germane wera more
warlike in the time of Obarlemagne than before. Not so;
witness the names of Alarie, Ebrio, Theodoric, Oloris, bc.

If this view will not suffice, let us try another. Let us
ask if it may not be the case, that, when those Germane, who
are admitted to have left their country in great numbers,
migrated southwards, they left vast gaps in tbe population of
their original areas, which the Slavonians from behind lilled
up, even by the force of pressure3 since geography abhors a
vacuum as much as nature is said to do.

1 will not say that this view is wholly nnsupported by in-
duction. Something ol' the kind may hs found amongst the
Indians ol North America, where a hunting·grouud abandoned

byone tribe is appropriated by another. The magnitude,
however, of such vacuities is trifling compared with the one
in question; besides which, the Indian migratione are those
of a pastoral people, who take their wives and children with
