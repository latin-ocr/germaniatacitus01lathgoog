Between those Tacitus draws the distinction (indicated in
p. 100) by the words baad datm from which I infer that,
in the case of the first two populations, on this list, to which
the words do aot appiy, thoro roas ο docta

I do not, then, prees the arguments against the Germanic
character of the Vangiones, Triboci, and Nemetes-though
some serious elemento of doubts are opposed to them. Thus-

ο. The name of the Tri-boci is Keltic=the trs in the
Keltic names of places. But this Grimm has met by sup-
posing it=tirea so that Tri-boci=tho three dosches.

b. Tha names* of three out of seven of their towns are
Keliic-‘H δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ 'otptypa ποταμοῦ πρὸς μεσημὲρίον ·

still the three German towns may have had Keltic names
in the mouths of Keltio informante.

However, the Keltie forms Geor, as in Geor-philly, occur as
well-“ Tutor Trevirorum copias, recenti Vangionum‚ Cara·

The Treviri and Neruii come under a different category.

Respecting the first the statement of Niebuhr, that their
language was German, confidently as it is made, proves nothing.
It amnmoe the point under investigation. The unlikolihood
of the Gallie having maintained itself until the time of St.
J erome, is a matter for the render to decide. The German of
