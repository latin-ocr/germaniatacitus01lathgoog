Like Tacitus, Dion makes no mention ο1 the Chatta-arii.
Strabo does; his form being Χαττουάριοι.
So does Velleius Paterculus; his form being Atta-arii.

Ptolemy’s Χαιτούωροι introduce a complication which wiil
be noticed in the sequel. '

The locality ο1 the Ohatt-uarii ο1 Strabo and Paterculns
was the watershed cf the Buhr and Lippa. Strabo mentions
them in conjunction with the Gambrivii aud Paterculus with
the Bructeri-“ Intrate protinus Germania, subacti Ganine-
fatos, Attuarii, Bructeri, recepti Cherusci.”-ii. 105.

They increase in historical promiueuce as we advance; and
in the reign of Julian, Ammianus writes “Rheno exinde
transmisso regionem subito pervasit Francorum quos Attu-
arios vocant.'' —xm 10.

Between the eighth and eleveuth centurias the name is
common, aud numerous documenta speak of the tarra, papus

the Niers, a feeder of the Maas; so that the minute ethno-
logist may divide the Attuarii ο1 the middle-ege writers into
the eastern and western branchos.

But the most interesting fact connected with the (ihatt-
uarii is the occurrence ο1 their native name Haut-ware iu the
Traveller's Song, and Beowulf.

The king, whose son, the hero of the great Augle cpio,
Beowulf, succeeded, bore a name the form cf which was-

In aa, Hipslac—

Iu Icelandic, Hupuilcr-

Iu Latin, Charmuthas,-
being, variously called, aDane, a Geat, and an Angle.

His descent upon oue of the papi of King Theodoric is thus
mentioued by Gregory ο1 Tours :—“ His ita gestis Daui cum
rege suo, nomine Ohochilaicho, evectu navali per mare
