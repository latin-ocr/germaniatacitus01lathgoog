tions in boats similar ιο thet which took the Germane ιο
Moesia, took the Norsemen to the Black and anpian Seas.
Just, too, as thc navigation of the Upper Danube implies
tho occupanoy of some part of its banks, l imagine that those
parts of Russia, where ιιο systema of the Dnieper and Volga
come in closest content, were the scats of certain Norsemen;
intrusive members of the Scandinaviau division, who had
penetrated from the Beltic to the head-wetere of the rivers
in question, at the expense of the original Lithuanians and
Ugrians. The undoubted fluviatile character of this migra-
tion is an argurment in favour of that of the Goths of Moesia
having been fluviatilo also.

The evidence in support of this doctrine is as follows :-

stantinople was dy water 2—Kar' ἐκεῖνον «γὰρ τὸν καιρὸν τὸ
μιαιφονώτατον τῶν Σκυθῶν ἔθνος, οἱ λεγόμενοι Ῥοῦς, διὰ τοῦ
Εὐξείνου πόντου προσκεχωρηκότες τῷ Στενῷ, καὶ πάντα μὲν

2. It was fluviatili, ia, oid a river rather than the ocean.
The proof of this lies in a long quotation hom the Archiou
writer Ibn Fozlan, to be found in Zenss (p. 550), describing
their descent upon Georgia and Ajcrbijau‚ by means of a fleat
on the Caspiae.

quosdam, qui se, idest ριπιινι mm Illos vocari dicebant,
quos rex illorum, (lhacanus vocabulo, adse amicitiae, sicut
asserebant, causa direxerat, petens per memoratam epistolam,
quatenus benignitate imperatoris redeundi facultatem atque
auxilium per imperium sunm totum habere possent, quoniam
