t. tte cubem—In the early pcems alluded to, the subject is what
the present statement of Tacitus leads ue ιο expect ule deeds of
great warricrs ere narrated, end the pcems approach the character of
epioe. Beowutr: the poem last quoted, contains upwards of seren

is also, ιο all appearances, Hanoverian.

ln the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the entry under s.n. 937, in-
stead of being a statement in prose is a poem of considerable length,
