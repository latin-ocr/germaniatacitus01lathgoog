one. Hence Ι put the accounts ol Jornandes low; because
they are just the accounts which the existing state ol things
would call for—just as, 1 imagine, that the similar relations of
the lsle of Wight population‚ the Angles‚ and the Saxone, did
with Beda. Yet l put what may be called the pluri-presence
of a population called D-cs (or Dc), in geographical contest
with a population called Gt, high; and admit it to be the
best reason existing in favour of the deductiones the Daci
and Geta from the Baltic.

Yet it is not conclusive. Names may be what ie con-
veniently called correlative. Thus :-

c. Let D-n=cocetman‚ and Gt, a nean os llic inustor
courcy (or cicc υενεά); or·-

b. Let Dc=mcuntcincca and G-t=hnclcndcr (or cicc
ceree); or·-

c. Let D-n=nctlcc‚ and G-t=sorcipncr (or cicc ceroci).

(lases of this sort may easily be multiplied. Any one of
them, however, shows that, wherever certain physical or
social conditione involving the correlation in question occurs,
corresponding names may occur alsa—and that, independent
of any desccnt or migretion

Ido not say that this was the case in the present instanoe;
having no tittle cf evidence to support its application to the
case before ns. Ι only say that such an hypothesis ie good
against the assumption of any equally gratuitous migration.

This is complementary to the note in v. Cherusci.

Gaesar mentions the Hcmdcs, as forming a part of the
army of Ariovistum and he is the lirst author who mentions
them at alh-but says nothing about the Cherusci.

Tacitus mentions the Cherusci, but not the Harudes.

The Marmor Ancyranum has the form Olcrudcs.

The change from ot- to H· (and cicc ocrea) has olten been
mentioned already‚—Olctti= Heccc, Chattuarii = Hazzoccti.

Form for form, l think Horati-is the root ol' the word
Olor-usci.
