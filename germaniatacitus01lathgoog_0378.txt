Notwithstanding this, 1 think it is an open question,
'whether the name may not have been applied by the truer and
more noequivocal Germana cf Suebia and Franconia, to certain
less definitely Germanic allies from Wurtemburg and Baden,
—parts of the Decumates agri,-perts which might have
supplied a Gallie, a Gallo-Roman, or even a Slavonic clement
to the confederacy; iu which case, a name so Genaua as to
have given the present French and Italian name for (launoy,
Ι may, originally, have applied to a population other than
Germanic.

Iknow the apparently paradoxical elementa in this view;
but I also know that, in the way of etymology, it is quite
as sale to translate ull by ulii, as by omues: and I cannot
help thinking that the ol in Alemanni is theol in altr-arto
(a screipner, or mou of another sort), oli-benzo (aa alicu), and
cldlaud (captivity io foreign luuh-Grion, ii. ces-Reclu-
salterth, p. 359. And still more satislied am I that the Al,
in Atemanni ia the cl· in Alsatia=el-sasa=ali-satz:foreign
settlement. In other words, the prefix in question is more '
probably the al- in else, than the al· in ull.

Little, however, of importance tums on this.

The locality of the Alemanni was the parts about the
Limes Romanus, a boundary which, in the time of Alexander
Severus, Niebuhr thinks that they first broke through. Hence
they were the Marchmen of the frontier, whoever those
Marchmen were.

Other such Marchmen were the Sueci3 unless, indeed, we
consider the two names as synonyma. Zeuss admits that,
between the Suevi of Snabia, and tho Alemanni, no tangible
difference can be found.

The area whence we bring these Alemanni, or Suevi of
Suebis, must fulfil certain conditione.

It must not be too limited; since it is the area from which
not only the agri Decumates were Germanized in the first
instance, bnt from which, eventually and indirectly, Switzer-

181¹de Austria have been, partially, Bavaria, wholly, Ger-
mamzs .
