b. Also, that they wera the ‹hpouryovrbt'orer of Ptolemy.

ι. hiso, the Orlpouryorirbot of Zosimus.

d. Also, the Bouporlpovrbot of Agathias.

ι. Possibly the Βαίρατιααι of the later historiens.

They were occupante of the parts east of the Upper vie
tola, or between the Vistula and Bug. They were well-
known to the Greek writers of the Byzantius empire; aud
the only question concerning them is, whether they were
Scythiam 01· Hune—Obrue δὲ ἅπαντες κοινῇ μὲν Σκύθαι καὶ
Οὕνναι ἐπονομάζοντα· ι’δία δὲ κατὰ γένη, τὸ μέν τι αὐτῶν
Κοτρθγουροι, τὸ δὲ Οὐτθγουραι, ἄλλοι δὲ Οὐλτίζουροι, καὶ
ἄλλοι Βαυρούγοονδοι. . . αὐτίκα ’γοῦν Οὐλτίζουροί τε καὶ
Βουρούτγουνδοι μέχρι μὲν Λέοντος rori αὐτοκράτορος καὶ τῶν
ἐν τῷ τότε Ῥωμαίων γνώριμοί τε ὑπῆρχον rrol ἄλκιμοι
εἶναι ἐδόκουν· ἡμεῖς δὲ οἱ νῦν οὔτε ἴσμεν αὐτοὺς, οὔτε, οἶμαι,
εἰσόμεθα, τυχὸν μὲν διαφθαρέντας, τυχὸν δὲ ὡς πορρωτάτω
μεταναστάντας-Αμῐὴῗᾶθι V· ll·

Still the similarity of the name is remarkable.

Considering‚ however, that their neighbours on the south
were the Gotle of the Danube, tbat the name is by no means
moereort'ly native, that their country was the water-abed of
the Vistula and Eup, aud that sosryurri=lill ¹ in Gothic, it is
by no means unlikely that, different as were the natione, these
names may have been the same, ie, the German form for
Hlplluorder. Still it is quite as lilrely to be accidental; and,
if the Burupundr' of the Bug were Bnlporiona is so.

But the difficulty does uot end here. Ptolemy has, luridae
hia Φρουτγοονδίωνες, a population ealled Βουγούνται.

α. The Αἰλουαίωνες (Helveoouae, see uota in· τοο.) lay
between the Ῥουτίκλειοι and the Βουγούνται.

l. The Lyytt Omani came ὑπὸ τοὺς Βοογούντας.

ι. The Βουγούνται came east of the Semnones, from the
river Suobus (Σούηὲος) to the Vistula.

These are very difficolt conditione. At first it appears that
we must separate the Βαντγούνται from the Φρουνγουνδίωνες,
because Ptolemy mentions both: aud that we must consider
the former to be the Boryuodt'ooe ol Frauoonia‚ beoause
Ptolemy does not mention these latter.
