⁶ Rachel-'Phe libiae, is anama by which the same river is
known to both the Franch of ite western, and tha Germana of its
eastern bank. Thia is not always the case in the frontier rivers3
since they may bear ona name in one language, and another in another.
It is far from anain that this vas not the case with the Rhine
originally.

Tho Frenoh and Germana know it by the same name, not because
their ancestors did, but because each has taken their appellation
from the Romans 3 the vvord Rterras is in the same category with
nonanta.

From whom did the Romans take itl To what ancient language
isit referablsl almost certainly to the Keltio cf Ganl; in which
the Gauls oriqtnoted, but the Romans diffm the name. It might
of course have been German aa well 3 though l think it unlilraly, the
original German name being probably lost. Δ

N either is it certain that the name natm vas persistent through·
out the whole nonme of the river. Tha hever Rhino might have had
one name, the Upper Rhino another, just aa the Lover Danube vas
called Ister, and the Upper, Danubius. Itis not likely that the
Batavians ol Hollaud‚ and tha Helvetians ol Svitzerland gave the
same name to tha very different parts of their common river. Names
of rivers only become general vehere there is ona homogeneous popu·
lation along their whole course ,· or, what is the something, when a
second party peroeivea the unity of the whole water-system. 'lhis
vvas vhat vas dona by the Romans, and that is the reason ior believ-
ing that, originally, the name Ratae vas a ραν-οἱοί one.

Is this term, cr one like it, applied to any othor Kaltic rivers so
that there may be several ntiae in Franco, just as there are several
Oaros and Avens in Englandl 'rna bearing cf this question is of
importunos. As the question amuda at present, the word is a Keltio
gloss of no great value, though of some. It is only a proper name.
If, however, it reappears astho designation of other rivers, the chauces
are that itis no propersonae, but a omnoaoa ternu no nord, like
John or Thomna, but aword like water, river, areum. Glosses of
this lrind are more valuable than the others.

Rhea is probably the same root as Rhodon ,· so that Rbine and
Rhoete are the same word in different dialecto. The disappearanee
ol the d orestes no difficulty. 'Phe very word Rhene, as compared

⁸ with Rhodanus, illustratae it.

It is also, probably, the sama word vith Eridanus ,· the ejection
