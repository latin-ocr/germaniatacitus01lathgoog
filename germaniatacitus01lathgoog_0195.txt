52 rus onnnsur on ricinus,

Die stat werd genennt auch Zmarre?
N ach der abgottin, das was der pris.
Der tampel als lang stuond unversert
Bis im von ulter was der val baschert.
Und da er von alter abgieng

Der berg namen von im empfieng;
Datus gestanden was des werck,

Und haist noch hiit der Zisenberek.”

“ They built a great temple therein‚
To the honour of Zise the heathen goddess
Whom they after heathen eustoms
Worshipped at that time 3
une city was named eke Zosas-is ’
Atter the heathen goddess, thst was its glory.
uno temple long stood entire
Until its fall was caused by age.
And when it from age went-off
The hill took the name from it;
Whereon the work stood,
· And still hight Ziseobery.’‘

confirmatory of this is an extract from the Augsburg Chroniole,
and, of equal velue, is a fragment preserved in two MSS„ one from
Munioh, end one from the monastery of Sthmmeram, wherein we
find a passage, aoeompenied hy marginal notes, headed “Exempto
ex Gallica Historia.''

These are too lengthy for quotation3 besides which, they are to
be found in suu in the D. Μ. pp. noo-272.

They agree, however, in containing, smongst much inaoourate
and distorted history, the speoial statement that the parts in
question were the head-quartem of the oritus os the Deo θέω,
“ Quam religiosissime oolebant, eujus templum quoque ex lignis
barbarico ritu constructum, postquem eo colonis &mana deducta
eet, inviolatum permansit, ao vetustate oollapsum nomen oolli ser·
ravit. Quinquagesimo nono dieque eo ventum est, cum is dies
120ae Cius, apud barbaros celeberrimus, ludum ao lasciviam magis
quam formidinem ostentaret,” &o

“ Qu. Zizoe nroe·-Grimm.
