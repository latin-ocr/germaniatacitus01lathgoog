worse or euenor v1. 39

² Framecs.]-'l'hie is a true German gloss. lt means a cutting
rather than e cutting instrument, its present power being pfriem=
ponet, cwl, bodkin. The surse is called pfriemeoalrraut 5 the hmom,
possiem-holm and the N ardus οιηιοια, Pfriemeto-gras.

Isidorus Hispalensis wrougly derives it from ferramentum,-
“Fromeo gladius eet ex utraque parte acutus, quam vulgo spathm
vocant. Promea autem dicte quia sema est, num sicut ferramen-
tum sio framea dicitur, ac proinde omnis gladius framm’'-0rigg.
xviii. 6, 3.

lt is difficult ιο imagine any objections to the connexion between
framea and pst-ieme, except such as aries out of the possibility of the
modern word having been derived from the phase in Tacitus-a not
unreasonable doctrine. This, however, isset asido by the extent ιο
which the word is shown by its compound, tc be tmly German. It
is also set aeide by the extent tc which it appears throughout the
Gothic languages—Dutch prom Angla-saxon preca, Icelandic
proca.

Objections, however, tace been raised The p is not exactly the
sound which, in the eyes os the striot believere in the uniformity of
letter-changes, grows out off. Neither is the diphthong exactly what
would he developed out os <a N either is the sense exactly the same
-“ The diphthong varies, end the sense does so still more—der diph-
thong aber abweicht, und der hegrif noch mehr.”-D. S. i. 515.

There is no objection ιο this minute criticism; indeed, in andos
itself, it is good. The change from foa topsr- is not of the most
usual sort3 perhaps it is unique

Again-—the ο in franssa is short, as shown by a line of J ursnal-

Per Solis radios, Tarpeiaque fulmina jurat,
Et Martis frdcaeom, et Cirrhaei spicula vatia-Sat, xiii. 78.

hnd a short vowel ie not the hest origin ιο a long diphthong.

Then, aa a sword ooo, whereas a framea dots, the “ sense is dif-
ferent.”

All this is good, is taken aem. It is good against an etymologist
who esserts that the connexion between pfrierm and framea is so
undoubted and undeniable that no sane philologist can demur to it.

Ιι is also good against any other etymology equally exceptionable
or unexoeptiouable.

But it is not good against such an etymology as the following,
followed up by the forthcoming inferences. -
