For the particular colony of the Warasoi, see note in o.
Nariact'.

In the same neighbourhood (ia, on the Doubs) were
several pupi of—

o. The Commeat, Amavi, taking as a later form, the name
pagus Ammona, Emona, and Amoaeensie—

ὀ. The Atbours's', Attoure'i, Ηαιιιανίἱ, or Hotoarii.

There can be little doubt but that these were Obonsavi
aud Chattuarii remov'ed from their original localitios.

Tha detail of such colonies is a point of minute ethnology.
They are mentioned here, however, for the sake of showing
that the presence of certain populations iu certain localities‚
is to be taken with caution. They may exist without the
parts about them being similarly occupied. In which cass
the population is paedia

Now, in order to constitute a true ethoological area, a
populatiou must not be isolated, unconnectad‚ or sporade'c, but
continuone.

The Germany of Tacitus extends from the Rhiue to the
parts about the umber-country of (lourland on the north, and
as far as Gallicis on the south: to each ot which countriee
we have special allusione.

For the intermediate portion of Europe, the frontier is
carried at least as far as the most eastern of these points; and
possibly further—possibly further, because the central nation
of the Lype'i, whose country coincides with the modern king-
dom of Poland‚ is described asa large one.

With these limite it includes Mechleuburg‚ Brandeuburg,
Pomeraniu, Eust and West Prussia, Saxony, silesia, Bohemia,
and Poland.

By the Geramwy of Tacitus, I mauu Tacitus according to
tha usual interpretation ; without either affirming or denying
that his text requires this extent of country to verify it.
