But, besides thie negative character of being nonSlavonic
(and therefore called Get), the two populations in question
may have been really connected.

A reason in favour cf this (aa far as it goes) is found
in the fact of the Slavonians differing from the Germane
in the following particulare :-

Tho Germane called ull couGermans by one name-
Weclli.

The Slavonians varied the name with the different ποο-
Slavonic populations with which they came in contact.

Thue-they call the Finne Tetrici, and the Germane
Niamcyr arrd this ie a reason for thinking that they called
none Gt, but the Lithuanians.

Further reascning on the subject occurs iu Epilepomena,
b Τιο relations os tle Gora ιο India.

No objections lie against the Getae and Gotionsr being
equally Lithuanic, from the mere magnitude of the area
If Slavonians could extend from Servis ιο Poland, Litho-
anians might from Bulgaria ιο Pruseia.

The objections that aries from the present limited area
of the Lithuanian tongue are but slight. The limite cf that
tongue have ever rcceded.

Lastly‚ it should be remembered, that whatever facts
brought the (iothonce nearer ιο the contisi, brought thern
nearer ιο the ,aare also.

Such is the hypothesie; which, whether convincing or the
contrary, is submitted to scholare with a claim ιο their
oarefnl consideration. Ιι explains the forms Gotli, Geta,
Goth-land, ,lut-land, Goth-inus, and Gotho, without assuming
any migratione dy land at all; only trosly water (one of
which is down a navigable river, and the other across¹ a sca
of moderate breadth); any displacement sc great as that
which is known to have occurred over part of the same
area within the historical period, and any power given ιο
any term more general than that which connects tho names
Wclsl as applied ιο οὓοωιπο-Βιίιοο, and Wout as applied
to an Italian.
