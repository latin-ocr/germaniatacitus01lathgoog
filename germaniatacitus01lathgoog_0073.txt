'l'bat Caesar was the chief first-hand authority lor the
main details concerning early Germany, is evident3 at the
saure time it is not in Caesar that the classification into
lngaevones‚ Istaeroues, bro, is to bc found. Neither is it in
Caesar that the parts which were not visited until alter his
time are described. The broad distinction between Gaul and
German is hier the Gaul being taken as the type.

The extent to which the names in (laesar differ from
those of Tacitus creatos certain slight difficulties. His uo-
mention of the Caua· is a most remarkable instance of this.
That Gaesar's names are chiefly Gallia, whilst Tacitus's are
Germanic, is, in the mind of the present writer, the chief
explanation here.

The greatest difficulty lies in the second and third ex·
tracta, wherein certain Belgica populations are made Ger-
man· I can only reconcile this with the great preponderance
of evidence in favour of the Belgae being Gaulo, by consider·
ing the term Bebrio in tha book of (laesar to be political
rather than ethnological; in other words, to denote a coa-
decrotiou rather than a homogeneous nation. At the same
time we may admit both intermixtum* and intrusion.

These preliminaries precede the following extremm the

criticism of which will find its place in different parts of the
body of the boolr.

mani accidisse, propterea quod eo consssio florentissimis rebus
domos suas Helvetii reliquissent, uti toti Gallim bellum in-

ferrent, imperioque potirentur, locumque domicilio ex magna
