Undonbtedly the pronunciation here ridiculed is that os ¹

the Gauls, and it is just possible, that init is loreshadowed
the curtailed form that the Latin tongne in general puts on in
the Freuch. Again, the slave whose contage failed him when
ordered to slay Gaius Mariuais called both a Gaul and a
Cimbrian by Plutarchus well as by Lucan. In tbe latter
writer, we have probably bnt a piece of rhetoric-Pharsalia,
lib. ii.

Amongst tribes undoubtedly Gallie, the Nervii claimed dc·
seent from the Teutones aud Gimbri. The passage of Tacitus
tbat connects tbe Nervii with the earnemcarnem them also
with the Treviri. Now a well-known passage in St. J eromc

Finally, in tbe Life of Marius by Plutarch, we have dialognes
between the Cimbri and tbe Romans. Now a Gallio inter·
preter was probabla, bnt not so a German one.

Sucb are the notices bearing upon the etbnography oi the

Gimbri. Others occur, especially amougst the poets; oi

above. J nstin speaks of embassies between Mithridates and
the Gimbri. Suetonius connects the cimbri with the Gallio
Senones; he ia writing, however, about Germany, so that his
evidence, slight as it is, is neutralized. Theories gronnded
upon the natioual name may be raised on both sides; osmeri

may coincide with either the Germanic kempu=a warrior or
elnmpion, or with the Keltic Opmry=0ombriuna Equally
equivocal seem the arguments drawn bom the descriptione
either of their physical conformation or their manners. The
silence of the Gothic traditione as to the cimbri being Ger-
manic, proves more in the way of negative evidence thau the
