say that Haase came from otoni is like saying that vomer came from

Loro German form.

Admitting this, we gain something more than a burron fact. We
infer that, in the particular cass of the Chatti, at least, the audieri-
ties oi Tacitus were Low Germans; a view confirmed not only by
the a priori probabilities of the case, but by several other similar
points of interant evidence.

That the Chatti of Tacitus arethe Suevi of Cacsar, is grounded
upon the—

α. Absence of the name Obcui in the Bellum Gallicam: though
they were the people most immediately in contact with Gaul

b. The history oi the war with Ariovistus

o. The magnitude ol the two populations 3 each requiring too
large an area to be in juxtaposition with one another within the
assignabis limits.

d. The absence of the evidence oi any considerable movements in
the way oi conquest or migration between the times of Caesar and
Strabo, this latter writer mentioning the Chatti.

Grimm, who, asa Hessian, has entered upon the minuto ethnolcgy
of his native country coo autore, has added to these reasons, and
found confirmations oi their identity in the local legenda of Hesse.
No reader acquainted with the vitality ol old bys-words, and with
the metamorphoses oi popular storias, will think the following points
oi evidence unworthy of record.

a. Let the word Chatti, originally Low German, but now Reman,
give rise to a nickname (Scbimpfwort), applicable to the Hessians.
Let thern bs called daps or sobelps, according to the translation of
the root of octabam, Let such a name apply to both the Hessians
and the Suabians. As iar as this goes, it goes towards the connec-
tion of the two by means of the common neme Gaui.

N ow a nichname (Setimpfioort) of the Hessians is Hand-Hemesa or
Dop Hesaicas (Hound Heaaiam): and a nickname (Schimpssoosa) of
the Suabians is blinds Scbwch=or blind Suebiae-even as puppies
are blind at birth.

Everything in ethnology is a conflict of difficulties ς and it
must not be concealed that a grave objection lies against the
identification of the Chatti and Suevi, in the fact that with the
ancient writers subsequent to Caesar, there isa mention of tho Saevi
