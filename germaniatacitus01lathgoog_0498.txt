worshippers 01 Terra Mater, would have passed 101 outlying
Frisians, outlying Ghauci, or outlying Ohemsci3 101 anything
rather than the representatives 01 0 separate substantive
branoh 01 the great Saxon, or Frisian, or Saxo-Frisian
division 01 the Germanic tongne.

This the 110911 1001000011 but how 101 they do so single-
handed, or how far the Eudoses and other populations 011 xn.
do the same, is uncertain.

Ι think they do not do so exaotly.

1. To begin with the Varini, whose relations to the Angli,
as already hasbeen indicated, are eminently difficult-

The mention 01 them along with the Angli, is a presump-
tion that they were what the Aoyhs were.

Their common worship 01 the goddess Hertlo is 0 specilic
fact; and 11 11 were a fact beyond doubt, there would bs 00
1011 1000000101 reliningon the natural 101010000 from the text
01 Το01100; 10 other words, although 111010 would still be a
balance 01 conflicting difficulties, the evidence of 0 German
object 01 worship, with a German name, in 0 German island,
would outweigh 1110 presumption arising 110111 the Worooci
01 authentia history being uaequivocally Slavonic.

But the lact is not beyond impeachment; since we can lind
the elementa 01 0 0010101 and excusablo error in the pecoliar
character 01 the cultus 01 the Angli on one side, and the
1701111100 the other.

What if the Varini had one 1010111001οΜ 1110110911
another-so that the insuta 0001001111 their corresponding
00010 0010010000 two in number. lsubmit that a writer,
with no better means 01 knowing the exact 110111 than Tacitus,
might, in such a case, when he recognized the 1000101011οω0-
ter common to the two forms 01 cultus, easily and pardonably,
refer them to one and the same island: in other words, he
might know the general 1001 that the Asyli and Varini
worshipped in 00 island, without knowing the particular fact
01 111011 each having a separate one.

This 10 what really happened: so that the hypothesis is as
follows :-

u. The truly and undoubtedly Germanic Asyli worshipped
111 Heligoland.
