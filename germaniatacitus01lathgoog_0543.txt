Plutarch mentions that their war-crios were understood
aud auswered by the Ligurians. Now it is possible that the
Liguriaus were Kelts, whilst it is certain that they were not
Goths.

Tha Toutonaa.-Appian speaks of tba Teutones having in-
vaded Noricum, and this nuder the head Κέλτικα.

Florus calls one of the hings of the Teutones Teutobocchus,
anama Keltic rather thau Gothic.

virgil has the following lines :-

—Late jam tum ditione premebat
Sarrastes populus, et quaa rigat mquora Sarnus ;
Quique Rufras, Batulumque teuent, atque arva Celennae;
Et quos maliferm despectant moenia Abellae:
Teutonico ritu soliti torquere curetas.
Tegmina queis capitum raptus de subere cortex,
AErataque micant peltas, micat tereus ensis-AEu. vii. 737—743.

Now this word rotela may be a provincialism from the neigh-
bourhood of Sarraste. It may also (amougstother things) be
a true Teutonic word. From what follows, it will appear
that this latter view is at least as likely as any other. The
commentatore state that it is coc Celtica That this is true

may be seen from the following forms—Irish: qa, apocr,
jocelin,· pecthelmo, adara port, capsur· (O'Reilly); yootlodl,
a jacetior codd, speum qai, uitta· acon yoidl, apsar-

aloft (Begly)-Oomisb: you, peto, pu, yui=lanca apocr,
jocelin, cltufl (Pryce)-Bretou: year, yooff (Rostremer).

Considering the peculiarities of the Keltic pronunciation,
this word calcia is perhaps the pesum of another part of
Virgil and the ὑσσ-ὁς of Appian, as well astho English
word yood.

The Cimbri-Tha Teutonas-Of eitbcr the Cimbri sepa-
rately, crof the Cimbri aud Teutones collectisely, being of
Gallio origin, we have, iu the way of direct evidence, the
testimonias exhibited above, oia, of Sallust, (liceto, Cesar,
Diodorus. To this may be added, that of Dion Cassius who
not only had acoess to the contemporary accounts which
spolie of them as Gauls, but also was enabled to use them
critically, being possessed of informatiou concerning Germauy
as well as Franco.
