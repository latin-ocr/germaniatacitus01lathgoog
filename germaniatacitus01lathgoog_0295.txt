I believe such ιο have been the casei ‚rho previous occupancy of
the valley of the Naab (et least) by Germane anterior ιο the invasion

of the present Bavariane, is necessary to account for their presence
on the Danube, in the second, third, and fourth centuries: besides

which the present text requires it
'l'he present text also requires that they should be either Hermun-
duri, 0r closely allied to them.

'Phe reasons for believing the Hermunduri ιο have belonged ιο a ¹
different section of the Germane (indeed ιο have been the chief ¹

branchos the Moeso-(iotha) will be found in the sequel*

Whether the Numici were Slavonians like their neighbours on the
east. or Germane like their neighbours on thc south, is, notwith-
standing the text, au open question.

As N αιιὲιοι, ue have no further specific ethnological information
about them.

lf. however, we allow the Οὐαριστοί of Ptelemy to be the same
people, we get a second notice of them; a notice, however, which
adds nothing to our knowledge ς merely doing what is done by
Tacitus, ia, placing them next to the Hermunduri (Τενριοχαῐμαι).

'ro get any new facts, we must go further still. Iret the word
Warasci=0bopwrcf=Nomeci

For the French districts of Jura and Doubs, on the banks of
the river from which the latter takes its name, we have the following
notice :-“ Eustasius ed Luxovium regressus est. Deinde ad Wa-
rascos, qui partem Sequanorum provincia et Duvii amuis fluenta ex
utraque ripa incolunt, pergit.’'- Vita S. Salobcryoe.

This speaks only to the pcepta uhe following, however, goes
further, and gives us the hypothesis as ιο their origin :-“ Pergit
(sc. Eustasius) progrediens Waresocs ad fidem Domini nostri Jesu
Ghrieti convertit, qui olim de pago, qui dicitur Stcdeuooya, qui
situs est circa Regnum flumen, partibus Orientis fuerant ejecti,
quique contra Burgundiones pugnam inierunt, sed a primo certamine
terga vertentes, dehinc advenerunt, atque iu pugnarn reversi, victores
quoque effecti, iu eodem pago Wareecorum consedenmt.”-Vita S.
Ermenfredi.

There is nothing improbable in this ; the river Regnum being
considered the Hegea. I have not, however, been more successful thau
Zeues iu finding euch a name ae Stadeuaapo on any of the mapa

'l Epilegomeuu, ξ Ostrogoths.
