It is just possible that the Baetamre were Germane-not thatI
mean by thia that the proper aree¹ of the Germane reached eo far as
Thrace and Moesia, the Bastarnic locality, hut that the Germane of
the Danube, might have begun their encroachments in an eastcrly
direction thus early, and have reached thus far. They might hare
been immotos Germane in the quarters where Livy places them.

But it is far hom being certain that ewen this supposition is
necessary. Strabo’s statement merely goes ιο their exhibiting uer·
man characteristics, and having Gemens in their neighbourhood.
Pliny is rarely to be taken aa an independent witness. Tacitus
speaks explicitly ae ιο the most characteristic facts3 yet doubts as
ιο the inferenoe from them. In one point he is either wrong or in·
expliceble. If rede mean orooroptc'ool position, his statement is
wholly incompatible with all that writers say about the locality
ol the Basternae (on the Lower Danube), and the limite ol his own
Germanic.

I think we may sasely say that, in the passage of Strabo which
makes the Butamre German, there is aqualilying expression of doubt,
and in that of Tacitus doubt and unsatisfactory lenguage as well.

Referenoe ιο other writers increasee rather than diminishes the
complicatione.

Livy’e evidence mahee them Gouls,· einoe he calls their leeder in
one place (llondicns dux Boatomonrm (xl. 68) and in another
(applying to the same series ol eveum) Clondicus, regulus (letheum
(xliv. 26).

He also writes—“Per Scordiscos iter sese ed mare Hadriaticum
Italiamque. Aliaria uadnoi exercitum non posse. Facile Bee-
tarnis Scordiscos iter daturos ; neo enim aut lingua aut moribus
aquales abhorrere.'’

Now whensrer the Scordisci are referred to any ol the recog·
nized divisione ol antiquity, they are called Palairos, or Gelli-
whether rightly or wrongly is another question.

Plutarch does the same es Livy—'treniaco di (nempe Perseus) rol
Γαλάτας, τούς περὶ rdv'lorpov οἰκημένους, oi Bocru'pros καλοῦνται.-
Vit. Paul. AEmil. c. 9.

The Bastarna were distinguished from their neighbours-warlihe
as these were-by superior brawery, wast stature, aud intense lore of
fighting-”Avdpec ὑψηλοὶ μὲν rh σώματα, θαυμαστοὶ dd τοίς μελέη,
μεγάλαυχοι δὲ και λαμπροὶ roic κατὰ τῶν πολεμίων deothario-Plut.
