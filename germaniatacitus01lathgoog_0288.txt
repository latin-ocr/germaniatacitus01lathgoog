Z iuuari ; of wbiob the second element is the word oore=tntatiranc,
and the first the root Teuc, with the first ι changed, and the latter
ejected. Of these three changes it is only tbe second that is, etymo·
logically‚ objectionable. 'lhe decomposition of the word into -soare
÷a prefixed noun is almost certainly correct 'l'be change from t ιο
eis nothing more than what the difference between a High German
and Low German form leode us ιο expect The ejection οἰ the
second t, and the connection thereby affected with the root Teut- is
illegitimate.

3. 'lhat tbe Old Higb German proper names Zuto, Zuzo,

'l'be words Terram matrern, when compared with our own word
cont, the AngloSaxon corpe, the Old Higb German erdo, the Moeso-
Gothic cintus almost force upon us the reading H erctum.

As cautious, however, mainel disposing os the N thus summarily,
we have the following facts :-

1. The fact oi there being noH in any of the German equivalents
ιο Tmo

2. The fact oi there being in the Eddaie mythology a deity named
N itrdr.

And against the conclusion that, even if the reading be Ιι, tbe
goddess must necessarily be Herua=naru‚ is tbe existence oi an
Anglo-Saxon deity Hrepe, with different attributes.

Still Ι think Parra Mater=Mcther It'artlc.

¹⁰ Imsdd.]-Heligoland.

ιι omnm-The German Ocean. 'Phe name Heliy-d=ltcly isle

favours this view.
The term Oceani does the same. Nerertbeless, it is applied to

the Baltic also.
