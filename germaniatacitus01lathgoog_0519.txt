languagee coming hom Europe. of course, there are reasons
for this one-sidedness, and, amongst these, the reasonable
doctrine that the human specics originated in Asia, the
eomewhat crude notion that migratione move from east to
west, rather than from west to east, ae if in obedienca to some
ethnological law, aad the unwillingness to believe that the
primary migratione by which the population of the earth's
surfaoe spread from some single point orer the four quar-tere
of the world, lie far beyond any existing means of investiga-
tion, are the chief.

Neverthelese, if we clear our minds of all this, the presump-
tione are the other way.

When two allied populatione, covering areas of different
magnitudes, are eeparated from each other, aad we account
for the separation by assuming a migration, the presumption
is that the occupante of the smaller area are derived from that
of the larger, rather than eico ocrea.

When an ethnological class falls into a certain number of
divisione, the portion of ite area, where the divisione are the
most numerous and the most definite, must be considered as
the oldest.

Such are the presumptione-presumptione which wc get at
by attending to the first principles of reasoning—preeumptions
which our common-sense supplice ue with. No one, lima-
gine, will deny their general validity, however much he may
consider that, in certain individual caece, they give us a wrong
result.

Thus, taken ty iteels, the presumption that arisee frum the
vast extent over which the English language is spoken in
Ameriae, ae compared with the limitcd arca of the Britieh
Ieles, is in favour of the American being the mother-tonguc,
which is known to be contrary to fact.

But the mere question of a magnitude of arca need not bc

taken ty itsolf. It is corrected hythe presumption arising
out of the second observation. In Ameriae, the English
language stands either alone or nearly eo. In England it has
its congeram around it,-Frisian, Dutch, Platt-Deutsch,
High German, and Norse; and this shows that Europe ie
the older home of the Engliehman.
