. patriation.-“ Eodem anno Cheruscorum gens regem Roma petivit,
amissis per interna bella nobilibus, et uno relique stirpis regia, qui
apud Urbem habebatur, nomine Italicus. Paternum huic genusa
Flavio, fratre Arminii ; mater ex Gatumero, principe Chattorum
erat-'’-hnm xi. 16. hlren if we refer a great part os this ιο Roman
intrigue-a probable assumption-the evidence that the recognition
os the great element of kingly power-decemt—was as true a charac-
teristic oi amne of the early Germane, as the sense of personal liberty,

is unexceptionable.
At the same time, it is possible that, in the more fenny and inac-

cessible parts of Friesland, parts less surrounded by conterminous
nations, the approach ιο either a republican er a patriarchal govern-
ment may have been closer3 the hlast Frisians, of all the Germane, at
the beginning of the period os undoubted history, being republican. ·

The name Italicae (and, besides this, there are several other in-

stances oi Germana with a Roman name) shows the extent to which .

certain individuale, at least, of the Germanic na'tion were Romaniaed.

The German equivalent os what Tacitus rendere rea (or rather the ,
German word to which Tacitus uses rec as en equivalent) was pro·
bably cystim in Angla-Saron, kunioe Old High German. How
far, however, this was a derivative from the word cyrce=9ew=us (kin)
ia uncertain. The best authorities hare connected the two.

sancet-The German word ιο which dere stands in the same
relation as rac does to centem is uncertain. At the beginning of the
literary period we find AnglcSaxon herdopa and Old High German
leo-izcolto the equivalents ιο duc,· and at the present day lter-chelsom
in High German, and ter-tesp-dom in Danish mean dolce-dom.
Whether, however, the combination h-r†t·p was asold as the time
of Tacitus is uncertain.

Perhaps the oldest form of our word carl (eorl Angla-Saron, jarl
N orse) has a better claim-at least scr the Saxona and Scandinawians.

The fact that makes the compound hel-tp doubtful ia the pos-
sibility of the German word top haring originated out of the Latin
dua (duc-e).

Supposirig, however, the two words to have existed, it is probable
that the lteri-lopo found his duty on the marchas, the eorl in the more
central parts cf the country.
