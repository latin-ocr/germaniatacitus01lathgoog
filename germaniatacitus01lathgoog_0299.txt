Perhaps the river Meros. Ῑι is not necessary, however, that it

should have any ascertained meaning.
1 take the words ‘¹ Marsigni masone mltaqtoe Suevos reserunt” as

they stand. 3

It is against the principles laid down in a previous part of the
work ιο lightly admit as Germanic any nation placed, like the
Marsigni (terga Marcomanorum-claudunt) beyond the March.

But itis also against other principles ιο treat a definite assertione

of an author like 'l'aeitns summarily.

We must, also, take the word Smne as he understood it, aa, as ⁹

meaning Gerousa-not as his present commentator does, aa, as
meaning Slcoom'e.

Hence, there are no preat objections against the Marsigni being
considered German-or, rather, as they are efrontier population,
and, consequently‚ involving no serious error either one way or the
other, there is no need sor an over-scrutinising criticism.

'Phe same applied to the Quadi and Narisoi.

2 dominil—The τι· here is almost certainly ol the same inflexional
or non-radical character with the -ss- in Goth-ones ,· and the same
criticism‚ in other respecta, applies to it-See note in v. Gotlonca

In Ptolemy we find that beyond the Βαινοχαῑμαι (Βοτοτίοηε)
were the Batiai-'tuly οὓς (Βαινοχαῖμους) Βατεινοὶ, καὶ ἔτι ὑπὲρ
τούτους, ὑπὸ τὸ Ἀτκιέοιιργιον ὄρος Κορκοντοὶ, καὶ Λοῦγιοι oi Βοῦροι,
μέχρι τῆς κεφαλῆς τοῦ Οὐιστοιῖλα ποταμοῦ. Ὑπὸ δὲ τούτους, πρῶτοι
Σίδωνες, εἶτα Κόγνοι, εἶτα Οὑϊσξούργιοι, ὑπὲρ τὸν Ὀρκιῖνιον δρυμόν.
Now Zeuss considers that Κόγνοι is a fault in the MSS. for Κότνοι,
which is likely enough. He also thinks that the Κότνοι are the
Κότινοι os Dion Cassius, and that the Κότινοι of Dion Cassius are the
Gothini ol' Tacitus-which is likely too.

The ison-mines, combined with the statement as ιο their languaga,
fix the Gothini in the Gallioian Carpathiens.

Gallica-linqua.-I know no reasons lor believing that the
name Holmoi, the Slavouic form for Gallicis is one whit less ancient
than the names Gallio, Britannia, Italia, Hellas, dac.

Until 1 do, Ι translate Gallica by Gallicicm considering that the
same similarity‚ with the same likelihood of creating error, between
words es like as the form out of which θαιιιοίο grew, and that out
of which the Romans formed Galli and the Greeks Γαλάται, ex-
isted in the time of Tacitus as now.
