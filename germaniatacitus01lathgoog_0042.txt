torily confirmed,—hearsay accounts, however, which have
just the same relation to the descriptione of the parts visited
by the Roman armies, as the data lor the geography of
ι (lentral Africa have to the surveys of the colonias of Natal,
the Cape, or Angola.

This leads us to anew series of preliminary points of
criticism.

A certain amount of migration and displacement is neces·
sary. If Germans were the original occupante of the parts
in question, the Slavonians must have superseded them
in it.

The likelihood or uulikelihood of this must be tested in
several ways.

First, in respect to its satsat-The assumed migration must
have been unsurpassed, perhaps uaequally, by any other within
the historical period. When the Germana of Charlemagne,
and his successore, conquered (or re-conquered) Transalbian
Germany, there was neither trees nor record of any previous
Germanic occupancy. Yet such previous occupancy rarely
occurs without leaving signs of its existence. Sometimes

there are fragments of the primitive populatiou safe in the. ,

protecting fastnesses of some mountain, forest, or fen, whose
savage independence testifica their original claim on the soil.
In this way the Welsh of Wales, and the Basques of the
Pyreneus, are monuments of that aboriginal population which
held possession of Spain and Britain, long before the begin·
ning of history, and which partially holds possession of them
now. Yet there is no want of natural strongholds in the
country in question. The Saxon Switzerland, the Bohemian
range, the foresta of Lithuania might well have been to the
Germana of Tacitus, what Snowdon was to the Britons of
Agricola, or the Pyrenees to the old Iberians; in which case
the pressat Germane of those countries would he the oldest
inhabitants of them—not the aewest, as they arc.

Another way in which a primitive, but displaced population
escapes annihilationis, by taking upon itself the character of
a servile population. In this way the Helots of Sparta,
represent the older inhabitants of Laconia, as well as the
conquered Messenians. Upon this principle Niebuhr argues
