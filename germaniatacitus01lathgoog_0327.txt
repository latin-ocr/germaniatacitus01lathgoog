In nn. 26, a Sicomdro colors was employed as fer from
its own country as Thrace.

This is believed to have permanently settled in Hungary, on
the very spot whereon the city of Bnda was atterwards built.
In a work quoted by Grimm, as Iucoriptiouos Socrosanctae
Veterocaria, a stone said to have been dug up, ‘⁶ in Bnda veteri,
Matlriae regis Ungeriae tempore, dum fundamenta jacerentur
aedium Beatricie reginae,'' bears the following inscription,—
“Legio Sicambrorum hic praesidio collocata civitatem aedifioa-
verunt quam ex suo nomine Sicambriam vocaverunt?

The authenticity, however, of this stone is doubtful ; and,
even if were not so, the ethnological fact it conveyed would
be, in and of itself, minute and unimportent. It has been
noticed, however, for a special reason. r[he fact of Sicam-
brians on the Danube, as well ss Sicambrians on the Rhine,
has been admitted as undoubted. Instead, however, of the
colony being allowed to account for it, a Danubian origin for
the Rhenish Sicambriens, with migratione to match, has been
inferred.

By the end of the first century, the name Sicambri has
become of comparatively rare occurrence, and the very fact
of its not appearing in the Germania, ie a proof of the ex-
tent to which its greatness has diminished.

'l'he Frank successore of (llovis, as well as Oloris himself,
are often called Sicambri. In Gregory of Tours' account
of the baptismos Oloris, the bishop saya—“ Mitis depone
colle, Sioomdar, adora quod incendisti, incende quod sd-
orasti.''

“ In Sicmutrorum natione rex nullus illi (o. Dagoberto)

In all these ceses, however, the term is a titulat arctatam
no nation then being called Sicambrioa. 3

Like omri, then, Sicambri is a term which occurs

during the early period of the history of the population to
which it applied only.
