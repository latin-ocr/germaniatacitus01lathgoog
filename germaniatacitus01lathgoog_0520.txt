Such is tha case where the two presumptione differ-one
complicating the other. Yet even then the case is clear.

When they coincide, it is clearer still. Thus, when we
have a comparatively homogeneous language coufiued to tha
smaller ol two areas on one side, and on the other a multipli-
city of divisione and subdivisione spread over the larges, the
presumption that the occupante of the former are derived from .
those of the latter, is indefinitely raised.

To apply these rules to the present case-

Northeru ludia, Persia, Armenia, aud a small portion of
Caucasus, form the mazam of area that can be given to the
so·called Indo-European languages of Asia.

Eugland, Germauy, Holland, two thirds of Scandinavia,
Russia, Poland, and all southern Europe, with tha exception
of Rumelia, Albania, and Biscay, l'orm the minimam of area
for the sooalled ludo-European lauguages ol Europe.

Now the least that is allowed to the tongues of Europe is
more than the nvoet that can be given to those of Asia. The
excess may bo but small ς still, pro tanto, it shows which way
the presumption is.

Again-the praetant amount of division that cau be got out
of the Asiatic class ol IudoEumpean tongues is tha Ossetic‚
Armenian, and IndoPersian tongues3 tha latter meaning the
Sanskrit and the ancient languages allied to it, with their
real or supposed derivativas—the modern tongues of Persia
and northern ludia.

The host amount of division amougst the Europeau tongues
is equal to this; for I submit that the differences between the
Latin (with its derivatives) and the Greek, the Slavonio, tha
Lithuanio‚ and the several branohes of the Gothic stook, are
fully equal in value and variety to those that any principle of
olassifioatiou can get from the tongues of ludoEuropean Asia.

But more must be added. Rightly or wrongly, there is an
opinion that the modern languages of northern India are not
Indo-European; and-

Rightly or wrougly‚ there is au opinion that the Armenian
is not ludo-Europeau-

Yet no one, who admits the term at all, has overtaken
exceptione to any of the Indo-Europeau tongues of Europe.
