x 'l'lllt GERMANY OF aloldus.

l ¹⁵· Blacks of St. Domingo speak French and Spanish. But, not

to go so far, no man believes that every inhabitant of the
British Principality who speaks English, to the exclusion of
Welsh‚ is as Anglo-Saxon in blood arrd pedigree as he is in
tongue. Neithor does he think this iu respect tobis Scotch
and Irish follow-citizens. lndeed, every man who, being born
of parents ol different natione, speaks only ons language, is

within the limits of Germany itself this distinction is not

Germane-few or many as the case may be.

Hence the evidence ol language is primd facio evidence
only.

Such is the measure ol its absoluto valae-a measure which
