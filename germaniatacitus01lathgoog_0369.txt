unaltered-we have only to account for its permanence.
Assume, however, a change, and you have an additional
complication3 since you have to account for its transfer as
well.

The present existence, then, of the term mdes: Go-
thoe—is an argument, ns far as it goes, against any change
of the original population; or, changing the expression, the
supposed immigration ol Lithuanians, and displacement of
Germane, which has been shown to be improbable in itself,
is rendered more so by the details that must be assumed if
wa suppose that the Gaddcn took their name from any Get·
iones who were German.

In order to make the Gallici aa Lithuanic as the aalma,

we must suppose one ol two things, either that the former
were an outlying isolated section of the Lithuanic etech, or
that the intervening areas between the Gothini and Go-
thones were Lithuanic. Are there any reasons against the
latter view-reasons against assuming the continuity of a
Lithuanic population from the Carpathians to the Baltic
(and oica carad), from the mere magnitude of the areat Nona.

The Lygian‚ which was parallel with it, is, in the same .

direction (from south to north), fully or nearly as large.

From the present distribution of the Lithuanian dialects,
there are several ; but that these are not insuperable, is shown
in the Proleyomeao.

Ido not, however, press the point, since the approach of
the Gothini to the servile condition indicates the possibility
of their having been an outlying colony of captives.

All that Ι urge is the reference of the two (Gothini and
Gethones) to a common ethnological division (that division
being the Lithuanic), and the hypothesis which accounts for
the similarity of names.

lalso urge the necessity of bringing the older Lithuanians
as far sorith as the parts just north of Gallicis, even il we
hesitate to continue them up to the very country of the
Gethones.

For clear and definite history—aud we must remember
that history for these parts begins hut little before the twellth
century- brings a Lithuanian population as sar in tbe direc-
