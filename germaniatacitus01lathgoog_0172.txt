those of the Gauls is credible; but that the come was the same is
unlilrely. In the present case, then, Tacitus describes a German
oustom by a Gallio name. That his error goes thus far I believe.
I do not, however, believe that it goes farther; in other words, 1 do
not think that the practice which he describes is so Gallicas not to
be Germanic also ,· or that he has confused the oustom aa well as
misapplied the term. a

At the same time there is another view which may be taken. lt
is just possible that Gallio bards might have formed part of the
retinue of certain German chiese ; iu which case they may beve been
called by their employers by the name they bois at home. However,
¹ the national character of their functione, consisting as it did of the
recital of octies poenis, is against this.

Lastly-if a reasonable interpretation of the root brol, een be
obtained from any Gothic tongue, all objections against the present
statement falls to the ground.

At present, however, it is best explained by assuming the falli·
bility of the author in which it occurs.

Lucan’s notice of the bardis poetry and doctrine is as follows :—

Vos quoque qui fortes animas, belloque peremptas
Laudibus in longum vates dimittitis avum,
Plurima securi fudistis carmina Bardi.
Et ros barbaricos ritus, moremque sinistrum
Sacrorum Druidae positis repetistis ab armis.
Solis ndsse deos, et coeli numina vobis,
Aut solis nescire datum est; nemora alto remotis
Incolitis lucis: vobis auctoribus, umbrae
N on tacitas Erebi sedes, Ditisque profundi
Pallida regua petunt 3 regit idem spiritus artus
Orbe alio ; longua, canitis si cognita, vitm
Mors media eet. Certe populi quos despicit Arctos,
Felices errore suo, quos ille timorum
Maximus, haud urget leti metus; inde mendi
In ferrum meus prona viris, animasque capaces
Mortis, et ignavum redituras parcere vita.
