cvi nnn cunuaur or vacuus.

The best evidence of their being Genuum ie that of the
names of their leaders3 but such evidence would make the.
Spaniards who fought under Wellicytoa‚ Englishmen.

But what if we find Varie· on the Rhine, e comparatively
northern localityl The most that follows from this is a
doubt as to which of the two nearly synonymoua populations

Elpey were-Acoreui of the Vistula, or Varini of the Lower
be.

What if we find them in connection with the Aczyll? This
helpe us in the decision‚ and inclines us to prefer the Varini:
hut it by no means proves connection.

But what if they be Anaphe in Thuringial This, again,
only makes us pause in deciding which Acylcc are meant.
lt never touchcs the connection.

What if wc find thamin contact with the Danesl This
denotes that the particular V-r-a- thus described were Varini.

But what if Daai=Dcci?* This throws us back on the
Aoorcai. ι

Nothing, however, touches the connection. lt ia only the
details thet are compliceted: details which are jerat as diffi-
cult, whether we suppose emigration or not.

All this really happens, aa may be seen by comparing the
following extract with the Epitvpomcca, §§xu1.andxr.n.:-
Οὔαρνοι μὲν ὑπὲρ Ἴστρον ποταμὸν ἵδρυνται, διήκουσι δὲ
ἄχρι τε ἐς Ὠκεανὸν τὸν ἀρκτῲον καὶ ποταμὸν Ῥῆνον, ὅσπερ
αὐτούς τε διορίζει καὶ Φράιγγους καὶ τᾶλλα ἔθνη, ἃταύτῃ
ἵδρυνται. Οὗτοι ἅπαντας, ὅσοι τὸ παλαιὸν ἀμφὶ Ῥῆνον
ἑκατέρωθεν ποταμὸν ᾤκηντο, ἰδίου μέν τινος ὀνόματος ἔκαστοι
ρετελάιγχανον . . . ἐπὶ κοινῆς δε Γερμανοὶ ἐκαλοῦντο ἅπαντες
. . Οὔαρνοι δὲ καὶ Φράγιγοι τουτὶ μόνον τοῦ Ῥήνου τὸ ὕδωρ
μεταξὺ ἔχουσιν.-Ραοοορ. Bell. Goth. iv. 20.

Again, ΙἘρουλοι . . ἔρημον δὲ χώραν διαθάντες ἐνθένδε
πολλὴν ἐς τοὺς Οὐάρνους καλουμένους ἐχώρησαν. Μεθ’ οὓς
δὴ καὶ Δανῶν τὰ ἔθνη πορέδραμον.-Ριοοορ. Bell. Goth. ii. 15.
