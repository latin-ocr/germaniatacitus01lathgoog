phically) Burgundiau Merovingiaus, give the chief reason
for believing that those tribes who were politicellu Franks
of the Upper Rhiue, were ywyruplieelly aud etlaolepicelly
Burgundians‚ at least for the middle portion ol them. 'l'he
southern members ol' this group were probably Suerim, the
northern Hessian.

Agaiu-tbe relations ol the Burgundiau Gunther to the
Frank Sigfrid, in tlre traditione embodied in the Nibclungen
Lied connect the two.

and the greater necessity for a number of specilic ones. The

When the necessity sor the distinction between the de-

The time of the actions of the Franks of the Lower
Rhiue, was a little later thau that ol those of the Upper; but
it lasted longer. Its development consisted in the conquesta

of Oloris and (lharlemagne. Its measure is to be found in the
