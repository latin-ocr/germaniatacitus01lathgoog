The Bavarian side of the great Alpina chain consiste of an
elevated tableland the Italian oi a series of mountain-valleys,
which change in character aa we approach the alluvial plain oi
Lombardy ; and aa these change, we pass from Rhatia to Italy,
from the Tyrol and Switrerland to homberdy.

At the present moment the population of this area is referable to
two divisione. Α German dialect of the Alemannic type is spoken
in Bavaria, Wurtemburg, Baden, the Vorarlberg, and greater part
of the Tyrol. The remaining dialecto are derivativee from the Latin.
It is necessary to know that these last fall into two divisions; the
Italian of Lombardy, the Valteline, and Tessino, and the Rooecnce
os the Grisons or Graubriindten. Itis the Griaon or Graubrtindten
country which is pre-eminently and typically Rhaetian3 the Grisen
mountains are the Rhaetica Alps, and the creontem of speech
is often called the Rtoetc'oa lsnguage.

If, from the Lake of Constanee we follow up the Rhine towards
its source, we find that river and the Inn rise on different sides ot'
the same range of mountains. Now the valieys ot' the Upper Rhine
and the Upper Inn constitute the Grison country, where the Ro-
manee language is spoken, and where it falls into two chief dialecto,
coinciding with the two river-systema. The proper Rornanee is the
language of the hilis and ralleys on the Upper Rhine ; the Lacca,
or Latin, that of those on the Upper Inn. Then subdialects oocur3
the Ladino falling into the Upper Engadino, and the Lower Enga-
din03 the Romanoa into several similar ones.

Such is the present philologieal ethnography of the Rhaetica.
But as both classes of langueges have been introduced into the
country within the historical period—the German in the fifth and
cinth centuries, and the Roman in the time of Augustus-neither
throws much light upon the character of the original population,

Were there any Germana in Rhatiai Germane might heve been
found in the northern point of Vindelicien Rhaetia, just as there
were Germans in Gau13 ie, as intr-usiae emigrante, but not aa inte·
gral portione of the original RhaetoVindelieian population.

of the populations of Noricam, the portion of the Danube which
separated Pannonia Proper from the Germany os Tacitus, was that
part which lies between the northern extremity of the Kahlenberg
