the true Burgundiaus, in a manner the very reverse of the
preceding remarks.

The Mapodryyor ol' Ptolemy, ou the Thuringiau frontier,
were Burgundian.

But these Μαρούιγγοι are Meroer'npioos.

Hence, the Merovingians of Franco are Merovingians, ¹
not because thoy were the Merovingians of the conquerere of
that empire, but because they were the Merovingians ol Bur-
grmdy, or (perhaps, more speoifioally still, of) Fraaabe- Ι
Comte. ' r ·

It is stated iu the preceding chapter, that part of the ἰ
history ol another and different populatiou may have been
attributed to the Burgundiaus of Burgundy,

Pliny (H. N. iv. 14) writes, ‘⁶ Germanorum genera quinqua:
Vindili, quorum 'pars Burgundiones, Varini, Carini, Guttones.
Alterum genus Ingaevones, quorum pars Cimbri, Teutoni ac
Chaucorum gentes. Proximi autem Rheno Istaevonee, quorum
para Cimbri mediterranei Hermiones, quorum Suevi, Her·
munduri, Chatti, Cherusci. Quinta pare Peucini, Bastarna
. . contermini Dacis.”

This place, with Daci, Vindili, Varini, Carini, aud Guttoues,
is somewhat strange for a people of Franconia. Its proper clae-
silicatiou was, surely, with the Saevi, Hermunduri, Chatti, tre.

To this it may be added, that there are several isolated
actions, such es a contest with the Goths, and another with
Fastida, king of the Gepida, which give ue Burgundiones too
far down the Danube, to leave the history ol' the Burgundians
of Burgundy so simple,as it was left iu the chapter referred to.
ln other words, there must be either migration or another
populatiou calledflBarpandr‘oa.

The second alternative seems preferabler indeed the exiet·

enee of such a second populationis so certain, that the question
is, not whether there were two Burgundies, hut which of the
two it was that Fastida (or the (lotha) fought against, aud

which it was that Pliny meant by Beryeedioee.
a. I think that these two were the same.
