For the opinions as to the meaning oi the term Hermen,
see pp. 47-49.
The root dur· reappears in the Τευρ-ιο-χαῖμαι of Ptolemy ; a

componnd of Tene·- and bambanem just as coemamus Ιιοπισ
os tte Boii. All this is pointed ont by Zeuss, who expressly says
that Hermon-duri is evidently a compound (ammonentem compo-
situm) and also that the Τευριοχαῑμαι of Ptolemy means the same
people.

The identificaticn of both forms with the modern form Thur-ingen
(Thur-inqic), is equally probable. The eng is the gentile or patro-
nymio affin-consequently no part ot the original word.

'l'he change from d to t, which occurs between Tacitus and Ptolemy,
occurs in the more modern forms alsc; Drrrinc,= Tur-bey, being the
Old High German word.

This justifies usin considering the population, whose name appears
as the second element os the word Hermen-duri, es the occupante ol
the parts between the Werra and the ssn03 or the present district
oi Thuringiu, wherein we lind a Por-you.

All this is confirmed by the following observatione ot huss.
After thcddarcomannic war, in which they took part, the Hermun-
duri disappcar. Suesia, which, in the Roman maps, fills up the
country between the Bructeri and Alemanni, in its eastern parte,
represents their country. J ornandos, who mentione them but onoe,
does so in a loose and general way, and evidently on the authority
oi older writers. Speaking of the Vandals oi the first helios the
fourth century, he says-“ Erant namque illis tnnc ab criente Gothi,
ab occidente Marcomanni, a septentrione Hermunduri, a meridie
Hister, qui et Danubius dicitur.''—O. 22. From this time forwerda,
history lrnows no Hermunduri, but, from the fifth century down-
warde, Peringr', floriaci, and Thuringi, in their steed. Thst the
Thuringians are in newiss edifferent people from the esrly Hermun-
duri, can be safely admitted, sinos we discover neither how so ocn-
siderable a populetion as the latter, should hese been lost, nor
whence such a one as the former could have originated. Besidcs
which, the later writers always place the Thuringians at the back
os the Franks and Alemanni, and between them and the Saxone,
this being the original country of the Hermen-duri.

Upon the locality of the Hemnundorcm dodae, Ican throw no light.

The extent giren in the text to the area oi the Hermunduri
requires notice. Tacitus brings them as iar south es the Danube.
