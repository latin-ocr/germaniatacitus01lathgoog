The reasons lor the existence of a Lithuanic population in
scandinavia, lie chielly in the facts which it will account
for. But this requires us to be sure that there is no other
alternative.

If the existence of a Germanic population will not account
lor the presence cf the form Gr (with its varieties) in Soan-
dinavia‚ what population willt

The only two that present themselves for consideration,
are the Finn, and the Lithuanic.

The fact of the root in question being known to be Lithu-
anic‚ and not known to be Finnie‚ is primd sacch in favour
of the former.

The Lithuanian is the only known family of which it ’
can be said that Gt, as the narne of one of its members‚
in the mouth ofa German would be likeliest of all known
names.

The only word that ean be set up against it Eoste=AEetii,
that being the only Ιοιοιοο German name applied to a
Lithuanian nation.

But as Easte=eastern it could apply to eastern localities
only; not ιο any in Scandinavia.

This leaves Gt as the only known name applicable.

Reascns for its being the one actually applied, are,-

a. It was, besides being the native, the Sboonic name as
well.

b. Ιι was hom the Slavonians that the scandinavian
Germana were likely to take the name of a population, between
whom and themselves the Slavonians lay intermediate.

c. Lastly‚ ιο certain of the Lithuanians on the soreth of the
Ballio, a compound of the root in question actually roas ap·
plied-East from Poland is Reid-yota·land-“ En austr fra
Polena er Rois-porclandss'- Fragment from the Fornaldar
Sb'gur. (Zeuss, p. 500).

The Lithuanians then, south ol the Baloie, are called by
the ancestors of the present Danas, Swedes‚ and Norwegiana‚
G-r. Surely, the same name, applied by the same pecple on
the nortl of the Baltic, is likely to have been applied ιο
Lithuanians also.

III. What applies ιο the Goths ol Gotleland applies also
