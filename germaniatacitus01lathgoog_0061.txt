11 by no means follows that, because the Germania 01
Tacitus constitutas a very large tract 01 country, the micola 01
tho area occupied bytho Germanic stock was therefore known
to that author.

He writes that it was separated from Dacia aud Sarmatia
montibus ont mutuo mac.

Thi· is not the language 01 0 precise geographer—indeed,
precisa geography ior the parts in question was in Tacitus's
time an impossibility.

Hence, any writer who may hold that there was a Germany
or Germane, either 10 the north or to the east 01 110 limits
ascribed in the Germania, holds nothing unreasonahle. The
Dacians and Sarmatians might only have intcrnqrtad the out-
lineos that area; in which case Germano might reappear 00
the Lower Danube, or in Western Bassia, Germane 01 whom
Tacitus knew nothing, and 01 whom he had lost sight on
reaching the Dacian and Sarmatian frontier.

There is nothing unreasonable in all this; and the likelihood
01 the Germanic area of Tacitus being amatior, is just as open
a question es the likelihood 01 its being langor, than the real
one. Indiuidually, I believe it to be too wide ς’ 101 1101 is
00 reason why others should not consider it 100 narrow.

This bas been done. The greatest authority 01 Germany
has expended much learning and ingenuity (lauguagc mora
favourable than this cannot be applied 10 even the arguments
01110 great author 01 the Deutsche Grammatik) on what
may be called the Gotic hypostasis.

Let it be admitted that the chaneos against the name 010
locality reached by a body of emigrante, invaders, or con-
querors, being identical with that 01 110 locality from which
those emigrante, invaders, or conquerere started, are almost
infinite.

Thus, the chauces are almost infinite against the natica
New Zealand name 01 the locality of the present settlement
