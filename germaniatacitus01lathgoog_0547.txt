Keltic and Latin included), the roots uror and mori mean sec

chium eum Hecataeus appellat, a Paropamiso amne, qua
Scythiam alluit, quod nornen ejus gentis lingua signifieat con-
gelatum, Philemon Morimcrusam* a Cimbris (qu. Cimmeriis)
vocari scribit: hoc est marc mortuorumque ad promontorium
Rubeas, ultra deinde Cronium '⁵ (13).

One point, however, still remeius: it may be dealt with
briefly, but it should not he wholly overlooked, niz, the ques-
tion, whether, over and above the theories as to the location ol'
the Cimbri in the (limbric Chersoneso, there is reason to be
licre, on independent grounds, that Keltic tribes were the early
inhabitants of the peninsula in question! If such vvere
actually the case, all that has preceded would, up to a certain
point, he invalidated. Nowl know no sufficient reasons for
believing such to be the case, although there are sument in
ethnography many insufficient ones.

1. In the way of philology, it is undoubtedly true that words
common to the Keltic tribes occnr in the Danish of J utland‚
and in tlre Frisian and Low German of Sleswick and Hol-
stein; but there is no reason to consider that they belong to ,
an aboriginal Keltic tribe. The c priori probability of Kelts
in the peninsula involves hypotheses in ethnography which
are, to say the least, far from being generally recognised. i
The evidence as to the language of aborigines derived from
the significance of thc names of old geographical localities, is
wanting for the (limbric Chersonese. The arguments as to
the origin from J utland ol certain Keltic tribes in England ¹
(ay, the Picts) either rest upon the historical evidence
that has just been discusaed, or elas involve a vicious circle of
argument.

2. No traditione, either Scandinavian or German, point
towards an aboriginal Keltic population for the localities in
question.

3. There are no satisfactory proofs of such in either
archaeology or natural history. A paper noticed by Dr.
Pritchard of Professor Eschricht's upon certain tumuli in
