tion (real cr supposed) between the root Tent- in Tanton, arrd
the root dent- in Dent-sch. It runs thus. The syllable in
question is common to the word Toni-ones, Teutonicus, Tmou·
icona teudiscua, tent-iscus, trit-isle, deit-isle, tint-sede, demach·
whilst the word Dent-seh means German. As the Tenet-oneo
were Germane, sowere the Gimbri also. Now this line ol
argument is set asida by the circumstance that the syllable
Teot- in Tenet-ones and Teutonicus, as ¹the names of the con-
federates of the Gimbri, is wholly unconnected with the Teut-
in theodinum, and Dent-sch. This is fully shown by Grimm
in his dissertation on the words German and Dutot. In its
oldest form the latter word meant populor, notionol, vernu-
cutor,· it was an adjective applied to the oulpm torrpno, or the
veuraoular German, in opposition to the Latin. ln the tenth
century the secondary form Prot-eniens came in vogue even
with German writers. Whether this arose out of imitation of
the Latin form Romulidae, or cut of the idea of an historical

, connection with the Teutones cf the classice, is immaterial.

lt is clear that the present word Dent-sole proves nothing
respecting the Teutonus. Perhaps, however, as early as the
μ time of Martial the word Teutonicus was used in a general
sense, denoting the Germane in general. Gertaiu it iethet,
before his time, it meant the particular people conquered by
Marius, irrespeetire oi origin or locality.-See Grimm's

The Oimdri.—Evidence to the Gothic origin ol' the Cimbri
(treated separately) begins with the writers under Augustus
and Tiberius.

Vell. Pannonius-The testimony cl this writer as to the
affinitiea of the natione in question is involved in his testimony
as to their locality, and consequently subject to the same cri-
ticism. His mention of them (as Germane) is incidental.

Straba-Over and above the references already made,

Strabo has certain specilic statements concerning the Gimbri:

a.) That according to a tradition (which he dces not believe)

they left their country cn account of an inundatiou of the sea.

This is applicabis to Germany rather than to Gaul. This
