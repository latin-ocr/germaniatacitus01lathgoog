Lestly-altbough ve can, by considering the Batavian Chatti
to have beenan inconsiderable and intrusive population, get over
the difficulty arising out of the High-German dialectos the Chatti,

and the Platt-Deutsch οἰ the present people of Helland, we are not
at liberty to do so. According ιο Tacitus, the Batavi were eo far
from standing alone, that the Oaninesotes sverain the same category,
·-“ Oaniuefates ..... ea gens partem insulae oolit, origine, lingue
virtute par Batavis, numero superantur.”-Hist. iv. 15.

For a further notice of the Batavi, see Epilepomeno, § Batti and
Sabaei.

² Mattiacorum.]-The mention of the warni batha of the stlattari-
“ Mattiaci iu Germanic fenus calidi trans Rhenum ’¹ (Pliny, xxxi. 2),
-fixes them in the neighbourhood os Wisbaden. 'this is Zeuss's
iufersnce; and there seems no good reason ior refiniug ou it. The
fact osa mixed army os Chatti, Usipii, and Mattiaci, besieging
Mayence confirma this view. “Maguntiaci obsessores mixtus ex
Chattis, Usipiis, Mattiacis exercitus.”-Tac.llist.iv. eu-zeuss, p. 99.

’Decumuteaupros.]—The Decumates apri were, in the time oi

Niebuhr expressly states that, in the reigns of Augustus and
Tiberius, Suebis was not yet subject to Rome; his reason being
that no mention is made of any attacks upon Germany south of
the halin. Although this view rests upon negative evidence, and
isqualificd by the statement that all that is lsnown about this var
is vagus and indefinite, the a priori probabilitias are in favour of
it, and it would be hypercritical to reiine upon is.

Domitian’s actions in Germany are, probably, undervalued
Niebuhr mentions his war with the Chatti about the Maiae. He
also admits the evidence os medals as to the title οἰ mamus
borne by Domitian ς buthe demurs to the evidence of Martial as to
its being deserved5 adding that “ the historiens are unanimous that
those victories were not realities, though they munci be wholly
fictitious.'’ ln the subsequent lecture, he supplies the additional
statement that the “ Arm Fluviis, the name of a place on the military
road iroru the hlaine to Augsburg, proves that, probably under Douri-
tian‚ the Romans had already taken possession of that aneu imperi?
He adds, in a note, that Frontinus (Strategi. 3,10)expressly
