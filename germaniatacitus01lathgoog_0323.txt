178 aususausus os neonus.

The fragment os Scymnus makes them immigrants or conquerors.
otras δὲ θρᾷκες, Βαστάρναι r' ἐπήλυδες.

Upon the whole the evidence of the Bastarnae being German is
very inconolusive.

ι Vmcdi.]—The particular Venedi os Tacitus must have been
those natione os the interior who were too far inland ιο be described
with the AEstio' and Sitones of the coast, and too far to the north
and east ιο have been described with the Lypis' and Bur-ii, and
those other populations which were approached from the south.
These urere chiefly the bitbuanians os Lithuania; not, however, to
the exclusion os some os the more eastern Slavoniaus. Itis safe ιο
suppose this 3 since there is no traco of any distinction between the
Lithuauians and Slavoniaus having been made by the Germana.

³ Fennosque.]-The name Fica, as applied tc the natives of Fin-
lond is oct native. It is Gothic—both German and N orse.

Neitbsr is it native as applied to the haplanders of stentare,-
although many ol' them have adopted it
’ Hence, the Romans took the names os the Baltic Tiuns from the

Gemens.
From whom did the Germana take theml

A suggestion os Geyer‘r, adopted by B'dhr, is much to the point
Tho Pinnio root awos meansseu ,· and many Pinnio tribes eall them·
salves by names compounded of s-rn. Thus, the Esthonians are
Smne-&rarsd=sea-nwn ,· the Finlanders Suomarium, the Iaplandera
Sobroehrds, and the Karalians Srwmoemsy'et. Lastly‚ the name Sc·

uweid, which is oct native*t and which ιο probably a Tinn denomino·
tion adopted by the Russians, is reasonably supposed ιο come from
the same root. Puttiug all together, it is likely that the term Fen·
or Fiu- is the translation ot* Suom.

At the present time the ethnology os the tribes allied ιο both the
Finns os Finland, and Lappa of Lapland‚ is clear. anh section
belongs to the great Uprs'on stook.

But it is the evidence of language which has giren us this group.
The evidence os physical conformation is moro against than for it.

At the time of Tacitus no such generalization was practicable-

t The native nomo is Nosces, or summm.
