Of so much moro importance then the remarks of all other
writers upon Germany are those of Gaesar, that the chief
extracta from the Bellum Gallicum bearing upon that country·
will be given iu caleam. They require, however, certain
preliminary remarks.

Firet comes the distinction between what Gaeear observcd
for himself and what he learned from others. Of these latter,
hie chief informante were Gauls, and chief amongst tho Ganls,
most probably, Divitiacue the AEduan. The parts of Ger-
many which au AEduan would best understand would be
those of the Middle Rhine-Heese, Franconia, and the
northern parts of Suabia. The name by which these Ger-
mane were known was Saevi.

Another point to notice, ie the likelihood of the Germane
thus described haring spoken Gallic to the Gaule, instead of

the Gauls having learned German: inaemuch aethere is thc ⁸

special statement that Ariovistus epoko the language of the
country he had invaded; and that it was in Gallie that he
made himself intelligible to the Romans. There is uo evi·
denec of any Gaul speaking German.

Hence, it will not be surprising if many of the nemea in
(laeear arc as little German as the name Wclsh is (lambrian.
Without, at present, saying how far such is the case, it is

enough to remark that, amouget the German populatione of ·

Gaesar, there is only onc whereof the name is unequivocally
German, ae tested by its stmcture and etymology. This
word is Marcomanni =Mcrchmeu‚ or rnen os 110 boundarioc.

of the Germane of Ariovistus, Oaesar'e knowledge was
personal; but these were intrusive emigrante rather than
truc Germane, i.e., Germane in a Gallio locality, and (proba-
bly for that reason) partially Gallicised. The Germane for
the parts between Bonn and Nimeguen, were also similarly
known.

lastly, he speaks from his study of previous writers,
quoting Eratosthenes for the extent and name of the
Hercynian forest.
