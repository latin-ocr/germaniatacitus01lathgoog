Gaser’s evidence goes the mmo wey. His Bolentia joined Nori·
oum, whioh our Bohemie does not-“Boiosqne, qui uene Rhenum
indoluerant et in agrum Norioum transierant, Noreiamque oppa-
guarant, reoeptos ed se soeioa sibi edsoisount.”-Bell. Gall. i. 6.

So does thet of the following inseription :-1.. ronanam a r. m

We may now treoe the neme Bouaria. In the geographer of
&venne is the following eorrupt passage z-“Ilst petria quae di·

oitur Alea nngeni (l) montuosa per longum, quoe ed orientem
sumtum extenditur, eujus eliqua pers Baiae dieitur.”

lt is in the same geographer that the name Baiouarii first ooours.

Zeaas's reesouing iethet Baiae=Boheoeio ; that the Baio-uarii
oense hom thenoe, eud that oheuging their pleoes they ohanged the
l'orm of their name eleo. ‘⁴ The Baiouarii, Paigira, Baiera ere from
the oountry Baio. This populetion ohenged its looelity with its
nemo.”=Die Baiouarii, Peigire‚ Beiern sind die eus dem leude Baio.
hlit seinem namen indert des Volk euoh seine Sitne”-pp. 367,
368.

No one need admit more freely thau Zeuss, that ell eridanoe of
this migrationes the Baiaue hum Bohemie is wanting 3 es well
ee that there is no evidence of Bolemia haring ever been oelled
Bouario.

I oolleot‚ too, from his numerous end welueble quotations, thet-

1. 'l'he evidenoe ol the present oonntry os Bouaria being called
hy e oompound of Boiu÷roare, begine as early es the sixth oentury.

2. 'l'het the evidenoe ol the present oountry of Bolentia being
called by a oompound of Boio÷leaioeis no earlier than the eleventh.

1 also oolleot from the renudato, thet, though the Bereriens of
Baveria ere aelled Boii es lete as the eleventh century, there is no
instanoe of the Boioniaae being so called-seve and exoept iu the
eqnirooel oeae of the Boia of the geographer of Boreum.

'dhis reduoee the erideuoe os the old Boiohemum being Romae
to two faete—

1. nne neme Boia ; supposed to mean Bodemrh, from the leot of
its being on the water-system of the Blbe. But Aloe here may
mean the Seele- See not. iu r. Hermunduri.

2. The present neme Bolemio.
