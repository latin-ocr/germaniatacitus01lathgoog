EPILEGOMENA. v

Now, the name of each of these populations gives their
localities.

a. Tre-humes is the oldest form of the Dutch district
Tweate, in Overijsel.

b. Ampsiuarii = Emis-coare, occupante of the (Upper) Eme.

Both seem to have been on the emmeramiano frontier
(perhaps es Marcimeo), and, cousequently, it is diffionlt to
give them their exact ethnologieal position.

That considerable displacemeut occurred in these parteis
certain. The annihilation of the Ampsivarii is not so.

The name re·appears in the fourth century—“ Pauci ex
Aatpeiuoriie et (lhattis, Marcomere duce, in ulterioribus
collium jugis apparuere.”-Sulpie. Alex. ap. Gregor. Turon.
2, 9.

The Ampsiuarii of Tacitus ure, almost certainly, the Ἀμ-
plorat of Strabo. Whether they are also the Καμψίανοι of
that writer is doubtful-See Epileyoraooo,

5. decidaseam-The locelity now called Isia-heim, and
Koa-mere iu North Helland, is considered to retain the root
Oua· of the oompound form ; the power of thetinal elementa
being unknown, and the evidence of the word being a com·
pound at all being, subsequently, iuconolusive. Such, how-
ever, it probably is.

The Oauinefates are mentioned in Hist. iv. 15, 16, 18.

They are closely connected with the Batavi ; a fact, which,
usfar as it goes, is in favour of thet population being native
rather than of Heraion origin-See note in vr. Sudatti, and
ξ Batti, in Ehrebpwneeu.

A measure of tbe extent to which absolute and implicit feith
is to be placed in each and every statement, of even so great
a writer as Tacitus, ie to found iu his account of the Jews,
whom he brings from Orete. Yet it was eesier to write

correctly about the Jews, than about the populations of
(lourland, Gallicia, and Poland.

A dee Tuofuoo, Tauiana, or Tamfsna is mentioned as a
local goddess of the Marsi.
