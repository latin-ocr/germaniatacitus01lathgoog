the ooast changes suddenly from east ιο north ,· so muob so as to
make the parts in question, for some time, the most eastern extre-
mity of the Baltio. From Memel to Windau, the navigation is due
north, and it is only by keeping along tho coast that the Gulf of
Riga is found to lom ι bend towards the east rho Gulf of Pin·
land does so still more. But this ie only forawhile. rinund itself
is nearly in the same longitudo with Gourland

Uoleso, then, we take iu the Gulfs of Riga and Piniand, the
country of the AEstii is really the east-end of the Baltio.

Purthemore-except for the purposes of a special trade, the
gulis in question vere not likely to be visited ; since from the
position of the islanda Oesel and Dago, at the entrance of the Gull'
of Riga, and the uarrowness of the entrance of the Gulf of Fin-
land, it was not necessary for even the most cautious ooaaters to
follow the line of the land, on a voyage from Memel in Gouriand to
Abo in Finland.

Itis likely, then, that those Gemens, who applied the term AEstr'i
to the Gourlauders‚ made no account of tho Gulfs of Riga and Pin-
land3 in which cases the Ours‘schs delruny was rightly designated

Pytheas is the voyager, whose account of the Baltio about 320

nu is treated with some contempt by Strabo-i. p. 63.

However, it by no means follows that because the name was
Gothic it applied to a Gothic population 3 indeed, as far aa we can
get evidence for a negative faot, it is against the word AEsdi being

eleventh century of these saum AEctt, but it is only by writers who
were themselves either Gemens or adoptare of the Gomon geography
that the name is Horat, dist, or some similar form

General, however, as the name is iu the Gemanio authorities, is
it rare in those of Russia, Prussia, Polandl Probably, it is not to
be found at all. Instead, thereof, we bave the term Prues (Preterion)
or the more remarkable form Guddon.
