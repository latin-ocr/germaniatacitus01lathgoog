From the greca importunae of Wodeo in all the Gothic mythologice
whsrein he appears, and from the extent to which he appears in Υ111

With Matthew of westminster, and Geoffrey oi Moumouth this'
was certainly the view-“ Colimus maxima Mercurium, quem deen
lingui nostri appellamus.” This is, probably, from Tacitus.

As both writers, however, lived subsequently to the name os
