given at large, because Zeuss, who admits so many less probable deri-
vatione, not only keeps the adjective erut entirely out ol sight, but
disguises the word by writing it anas, on the very inferior au·
thority ol Eginhart—“ Litus australe Sclavi et alisii et aliae diversae
incolunt nationes.'’-Vit. Car. Magn. c. 12.

The existence ol the umber-trade explains the reference made in
the note upon the word θοιήοπεε to the present one.

The locality ol the umber-trade fixee the Gothones even ae it does
the AEstii, and by fixing them in the same locality at the same time
identifies the two.

This identification is os so much importanoe that the details ol the
proci will be given minutely.

Pliny's form is Goumara

Tacitus's in tho Annals (ii. 62) Gotoous,· in the present text
Gotbonea

Ptolemy’s Γῦθωνες.

Pliny’s locality is AEstoorium* Oceani Mentouomon nemim.

Tacitus's trans Lypios ia, north of Poland.

Ptolemy's παρὰ τὸν Οὑῖστοὺλαν ποταμὸν ὑπὸ roric Ohswa'doc.

Pliny connects thern with the suber-country. Ι

That the Κόσσινοι of Artemidorus is the same word is likely, the
εστ-π, as in θαλάττα and θαλάσση, doc.

Now, the notices of the sember-country might resch the Greeks or
Romans by two routes. 1. It might come across the continent, and
that, wholly by land, or by the Vistula, Theiss, and Danube, or by
the Priepetn and Dnieper. Iu this case the carriers ol the article,
and the informante as to its country and collectore, would be Sioua-
asans.

2. It might corde by sea, in which case Geminos would be-par·
tially at least-the carriers of the article, and tho informante es to
its country and collectore.

Now it is clear, thetis the Germana hod one term, and the
Slavcnians another, for a nation in the umber-country, that nation
would be known to aGreelr or Roman under two names ; audit is
nearly certain that this was the case in the present instance 'Phe
outone were AEnii when the notice carne from Germany. uns
AEsts'i were Gothorus when the notice came srom Slavonia.

hest this should eceman over-refinement,we must remember that,
il AEwtt :Este = Eudoses, and if the AEnion tongue were as
