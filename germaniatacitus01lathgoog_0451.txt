At what time the name first became an ansquivocal
geographioal designation* of what now, in the way of politice,
coincides with the Graud Ducby of Baden and part oi War-
temburg, and, iu respect to its physical geography, is part of the
Black Forat, is uncertain. It was not, however, later thau
the reign of Alexander Severus (ending aa). saa-me Ta-
bula peutingeriana being supposed to be referable to that
date. Themin, Austranum aud Sunvra appear together-
as terras lor that part of Germany which bad previously
gone under the name of Decumates apud, aud the parts about
the Limes Romanae.

With this, then, begins the history of the Saevi of rS'aabe'a,
or, rather, of the Sauliasae. Their allieuces were chiefly
with the Alamanni and Burgundians; their theatra the Ger·
man side of Franee, Switzerland, Italy, and (in conjunction
with the Visigoths) Spain. Their epoch is hom the reign
of Alexander to that ol Augustulus, iu round numbers, from
about au. 225 to an. 475, a period ol two hundred aud
fifty years.

Their maloram amount of historical prominence was tbe
time when Ricimer the Seculare, and Gundobald the Bargasa·
diua, made and unmade such emperors as Severus aud Oly-
brius, the immediate predecessore of Augustulus.

Now is the tima to taire a measure of the extent to which
the notion† that Saea- was ao aeliae damea arm ot aa,
bat a Keltic acme adopted dy tle Romnae, is a paradox, or
a probable infereuce from the early notices of the populations
socalled.

i. It is not a question whether the root daea- was Keltic
or not. It is known to bave been so.

2. Nor is there macl doubt about its having been from
the Gauls that the Romans took it: since it was probably
Gauls from whom (iasar learned the names of the allies and
subjects of Ariovistus.

l* Niebuhr mentions an inscription noticing a Victoria Saevire in the
reign ol Nerva. But there is no evidence ol this having been s victory
over the Saeui of Saubla. Caesar's victory over the Saevi ol Ariovistus vas
a Victoria Saevire, but no victory over the people oi the Decumates agri.
