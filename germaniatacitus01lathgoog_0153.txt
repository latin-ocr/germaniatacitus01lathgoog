There is a difficulty herc, which isinoreased by the fact of the
Danube forming hut partially the RhaetoGermanic frontier. A
considerable portion of the Rhoetia of Tacitus reached the Danube
as its northern limit, without, therefore, reaching the southern fron·
tier of Germsny. 'Phe Decumates Agri lay north of the Danube,
between Vindelicis, Gaul, and Germany. Yet it is hy no means
certain, that the Decumates Agri vvere German—See not. in von

Perhaps a more minute investigation than the present writer hm
had the opportunity of making, into the carly history of the Danubian
provinces just enumerated, would account for the omission of the
names Vindelicis and Noricum, and at the same time to inform us

⁴ how the Norioan population was to be distributed. *hl'present

however, l consider that Tacitus, in mentioning the Rhoeti and
Pannonis· only, recognized the alnohryt'col rather than the politiori
division, sud thought of the natural division of an area into its
nationalities rather than of the artificial distinction of provinces.

If so, we have an instrument of criticism ; since we may infer that
the Vindelici vere in the same category with the Rhaeti, and that
the Norici were either Rhoetian or Pannonian, or else dividod be-
tween the two.

'Phe othnologieal position of theRhaetisns, the extent to which
they consisted of one or several stoclrs, and their relations to the
population of Noricum, are difficult and complicated questions.
Neither arc they true portione of German ethnology.

Hence the present note will contain little beyond the notice of
the country and its occupante in their present state.

Politioally speaking, Rhaetia with Vindelicis, comprises the fol-
leving countries and districta-l. The Vorarlberg. 2. The Gri-
sons,or Granbrttndten. 3. TheVolteline. 4. The'fessino. 5. The
Tyrol. 6. Part of Lombardy. These form Rhaetia proper. The
southern part of Bavaria, the south-eastern part of Wurtemhurg,
and a small portion of Baden constitute Vindelicis.

Geographieally viewed, this area embraces s portion of two waten-
eystems, and a water-ebed, oin, the southern foedere of the Upper
Danube, aud the northern foedere of the Po ς tho water-rhed between
them being formed hythe Alps. Besides these the head-wetere of
the Rhine belong to Rhaetis.
