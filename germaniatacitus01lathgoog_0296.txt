The nearest approach ιο ἱι is a compound of -ccrng on tbe Bavarian
aud Wurtemburg frontier.

A sbade of evidence in favour of the original N ame having been
Slavonic, is ιο be got from the confusion between the form in -sc·
and thatin seq clue identitp hang granted.

Α Sceuae affinity would best account lor this; since, such a
form might end in -νίιοι (Narium syllable which contains both

the t out of which et, and the st out of which -οο- might be deve·
loped. Nayl auch an ending as eren aalma would bs nothing

As qi ἡμετέρᾳ may apply ιο any portien ol Roman Gaul, this
passage may give us the origin os the Warasci.

Agsin-as a mere guess, I suggest the probability ol their repre·

preliminaries to this note: indeed, to a certain extent they stand in

The Marce-maner in question were those os the Tshelrh or Bobe-
