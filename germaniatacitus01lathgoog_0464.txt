But is this the only analyeis of the two words—Banthaib
aud Wurcondaibl I think not. The commoneat oi all the
terminatione of the towns of Dacia was daca—Rusidava, bc,
as may be seen by going no further than Arrowsmith's map.

Agaim Boatcibie admitted by Zeuss to mean the -ratt (or
cib) of the Slavonic Antea* As lor the root Waroond‚ it
is, at least, as likely to represent the Urapnad- in Umquam,
as the Bury· in the true Barprmdiaaa.

To all this must be added the remarks in the note iu
v. bonwardi, suggesting that from the fact of the term
being an epithet rather than a separate substantive name,
there isa likelihood of there having been more Loeyodords
than one, and that independent of ethnologioal affinity.

Upon the whole, although the evidence of the Lombards
having originally been Goths or Germane, and the evidence of
their having affected a migratiou from north to south, are
not wholly unexceptionable‚ less objectione lie against them
than against any other similar instance: and Ι only con·
sider it doubtlirl when it ie made the basis of any ulterior
deductione-ench as that of making some very doubtful Ger-
mane German, because they stood in certain relations to the
Lombards of Lombardy.

Perhaps the structure of the Lombard armamenta may
have been like that of the vandala-German in respect to
ite chiefs, Slavonic in respect to the bulk of the forces3 in
which case the Langobardi may have been the analogues of the
Astingi; in which case, too, they may have represented the
Langobardi of Tacitus. The distant migration of a coprea-
tio or silacecfl secking war, is more likely than the distant

under a higher politicsl or administrativa unity, different ouly in degree,
and not iu kind from what prevailed individuslly in esch.

“ The kingdom is only a larger Ga thau ordinary, indeed the Ga iteell
wne the original kingdom. But the unsevcred possession or property
which wc thus lind in the Ga is by no means to be considered in the
same light ae that which hae been described in the Mark. The inhabitants
are settled as Markman‚ not as Gamen3 the cultivated land which lies
within the limit of the larger community is all distributed into smaller
ones.”—Saxone in Englaud, vol. i. 7³.

· Probably, on eastern lorm ol the word Wend.
