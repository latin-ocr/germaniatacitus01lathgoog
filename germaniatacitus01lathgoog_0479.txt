German, and but few hano considered Slavonio‚ we have in
the different Hun, Aion, Avar, and Bulgarian alliancoe the

It has boen stated that tho Alana were of the ank stock;
and as the Sciri have been placed in the same catagory with
them, the Sciri hoinga poople that has sometimes been oon-
sidared German, thc investigation of their ethnology finds
place in tho present work.

The two broad facts that bear upon this question are—

1. The area of the Alans is beyond that of either the
Germane or the Sarmaticus. This was the parts due north
of (limeseia, or the great irreguiar triangle formed hythe
Lower Don‚ the Lower Volgo, and Caucasus.

2. The present occupante of this area are the Nogay
Tartara of tho Turk stock—ocoupants who cannot bc shown
to be of recent introduction.

3. Lucian (Toxotio, 51) makes thern Scythians-Toriro δὲ

ἔλεγεν ό Μακέντης, ὁμόσκευος καὶ ὁμόγλωττος τοῖς Ἀλανοῖς
ὧν· κοινὰ γὰρ ταῦτα Ἀλανοῖς καὶ Σκύθαις, πλὴν ότι οὔ πάνυ
κομῶσιν οἱ Ἀλανοὶ ὥσπερ οἱ Σκύθαι. Ἀλλόὸ Μακέντης καὶ
ταῦτα εἴκαστο αὐτοῖς καὶ ἀποκεκάρκει τῆς κόμης, ὁπόσον
εἰκὸς ἧν ἔλαττον κομᾶν τὸν Ἀλανὸν τοῦ Σκύθου.

This reduces the stooks that may fairly claim them to three.

1. They may have been the most northern branoh of the
Giroassians.

2. 'l'ho most southern of the Ugrians.

3. anks

The Turk character of the present population savonrs the
third os these stooks.
