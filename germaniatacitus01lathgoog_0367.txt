Ι In deoyiop the name G·t to be native ιο the Gatheai,
i lassume that there is no special evidence in favour of its
being eo; and such 1 believe to be the case.

ln offirmiop the saure name to be native to the Goth-orrea
l am prepared with evidence.

Is the name which in Tacitus takes the form Gothum
native or foreign! known to the tribes ιο which it applica, or
as strange ιο them as the term Wolall ie ιο (lambriant This
is not answered in the reasoning upon the word AEatie' ,·
since it by no means follows that because one out of two
names given ιο a country is undoubtedly foreign, tha other
is necessarily indigenous. The fact of the term Germ ·
being indigenous is not a legitimate inference from the exotic
character of the name AEeto'i. Just as the letter designation
was German, the former may have been Slavouic; and the
one ruay have been as uulihe the real native neme as the
other.

Pretorius, a Pele, writing no. 1688, in his Orbis Gothicus,
devotes two sections to the following questions :—

“ An reliquiae nominis Gothioi in terris Europeae Sarmatia
reperianturl

“ Unde nominis Gadda contemptus hodie iu Prussia t”

From these we learn that the Samogitiaus‚ Russians,
Lithuanians‚ Prussians, Zalavonians‚ Nadravians, Natravians,
Sudovians, Mazovians, and the inhabitants of Ducal Prussia
were called Gonnons by the people about Koningsherg, and
that this name was a came of contempt, accounted for hythe
extent to which the populations to which it applied, had
retained their paganism against the efforts of the propagatore
of the Pruseian Christianity. “ Guddarum infidelium nornen
existit, adeo ut Gothos sive Gordos idem iis qui paganus et
ethnicus, hostisque Christianitatis audierit*

That it was also Slavouic isshown hy a line from an old

'l'shehh (Bohernian) poem.

Gotrtpy'o hrasnyja dirwy na brezje einemu morju.
Gott-r'rt fair maidens on banlr of (the) blue sea.
