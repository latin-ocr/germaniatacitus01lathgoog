of ideas in regard to their origin, oia, their hypothetical con-
nection with the Cimmerii. In this recognition of what might
have beeu called the dimotos-iao theory, heis followed by
Strabo and Plutarch—Diod. Sicul. v. 32. Strabo, vii. Plu·
tarch. Vit. Marii.

The next writer who mentions them is Strabo. Iu con·
firmation of the view taken above, this author places the
Cimbri on the northernmost limit of the area geographioally
known to him, οἱα, beyond Gaul and iu Germnny, between
the Rhine and the Elbe: Τῶν δὲ Γερμάνων, ὡς εἶτον, ol μὲν
προσάρκτιοι ταρηκοΰσι τῷ Ὠκεανῷ. Γνωρίζονται δ’ ἀπὸ
τῶν tutatur τοῦ Ῥήνου λάθοντες τὴν ἀρχὴν μέχρι τοῦ
”hastos Τούτων δὲ εἰσὶ γνωριμώτατοι Σούγαμὸροί τε καὶ
Κίμὸροι. Τὰ δὲ πέραν τοῦ ”Astus τὰ πρὸς τῷ Ὠκεανῷ

παντάπασιν ἄγνωστα ἡμῖν e’ortu—Lih. iv. F urther proof
that this was the frontier of the Roman world we get from
the statement which soon follows, οἱα, that “thus much was
known to the Romans from their successful ware, and that
more would have besu known had it uot been for the injunc-
tion of Augustus forbidding his generals to cross the Elbe.”
—Lib. iv.

Velleius Paterculus agrees with his contemporary Strabo.
He places them beyond the Rhine‚ and deols with thern as
Germane :-“ Tum Cimbri et Teutoni transcendere Rhenum,
multis mox nostris suisque cladibus nobiles.''-ii. 8. “Effusa
—immauis wis Germanarum gentium quihus nomen Cimbris ac
Teutonis erat.''-lbid. 12.

From the Gomoario of Tacitus a well-known passage will
be considered in the sequel. Tacitus's locality coincides with
that of Strabo.

Polemo-Now the author who most mentions in detail the
tribes beyond the Elbe is also the author who most pushes
back the Cimbri towards the north. Ooincident with his
improved information as to the parts southward, he places
them at the extremity of the area known to him: Καῦχοι οἱ
μείζονες μέχρι τοῦ hsttoc ποταμοῦ· ἐφεξῆς δὲ ἐπὶ αὔχενα
τῆς Κιμὲρικῆς Χερσονήσου Σάξονες· αὐτὴν δὲ τὴν Χερσόνησον
ὑπὲρ μὲντοὺς Σάξοναε, Σιγούλωνες ἀπὸ δυσμῶν· εἶτα Eudo·
