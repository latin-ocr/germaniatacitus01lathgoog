erroneous, or has subseqnent change taken placet No general
answer cen be given to the question. It depends upon the
credibility of the author on the one side, end the likelihood
of the changes assumed, on the other. If the changes are pro- ,
bable and the author unexccptionable, the decision is iu favour
of the change. If the author, however, be exceptionable and
the changes such es have never been previously known, the

converse is the case. Between these extremes there is every ⁵

intermediate degree. The changes may be of average magni·
tude, and the author of medium credibility. All this, how-
ever, merely shows that the balance between the conflicting
difficulties is easily struck in some cases, that in some itis
difficult, and in others almost impossible.

Iam not, just at present, prepared ιο decide upon the
particular case in hand, or ιο determine whether Tacitus has
been, at one and the same time, accurate in all his state-
ments, and rightly interpreted by his commentators, or
whether he bas not confounded Slavonians and Lithuanians
with Germane. This will come in due timo3 et present it
is sufficient to take an exception against the uncritical spirit
in which his evidence has been treated. Two distinctions of
paramount importunae have been neglected.

1. The artoarto which his statements ero at variance with
the first kuoua etate of tliaya subsequent to his time, hes
been overlooked.

2. The velue of hie evidence for the, parts which could
only be known, to even his best informante, by hearsay only,
has been placed on the same level with the valna of his
evidence respecting the parts personally known to his eon·
temporaries.

How different, l'or instance, were his means of describinga
Frisian or e Cheruscan, from his dcta for Poland aad Silcsia.
Yet Poland and Silesia are parts of the armenotheha,
end Friesland and Osnabnrg are no more. The legionary of
Drusus or Tiberina might describe, from personal knowledge,
the populations of Eme, orWescr3 but, whoever described the
tribes of the Oder or Vistula, would describe them from hear-
say accounts,-hearsay accounts, which I have no wish ιο
