The remarks on the extent to which a Slavonic form in
adlab- might be presumed when there was a confusion
between -ec- and -et- (see note in v. Nar-ieci), wae written
before 1 found in L. G. Daae'e work cn the Lithuanian Family
that the actual Slavcnie form for the German combination
Se, is etan (e’c' in Bohemian‚ ezra in Polieh, and tcta in
Russian)‚ and that the Polish original of Stiegletz is emypiel.
Such being the case, it is not toc much to suggest that the
very existence of a conhrsicn between -εί- and -ae-, ie primi
faeie evidence cf the true and original form being elleh, and
consequently of the word in which it occurs being Slavonic;
for it is only in Slavonic that euch combinatione occur.

ln p. 91 there ie a material orereight. The Boii are
placed between the Maine‚ Rhine‚ and Hercynian Forest.
'l'hey ought to have been placed in the parts beyond the area
thus circumscribed. Isay thie overeight is amterial ,· since
the true position cf the Boii was nearer Bohemia than the
text cf note in a. Boiollemum makes it. still, the correction
hy no meane carries it as far caet ae Bohemia; since the plain
meaning of ulteriore ie not ang part east of the Maiae, bnt
the parts that immediately (there or thereabcuts) succeed‚ cr
come n'ext to, the Helvetian occupaney. Now, these are

parte (and no inconsiderable parte either) cf Bavaria. Bohe-
mia, undoubtedly, comes afterwards in the same direction;
but so do Gallicia and many other places, The commcn-
eeuee interpretation seems tc he that where the Helvetians
lest off, the Boii began. Still, the statement in the text
referred to is an over-statement.
