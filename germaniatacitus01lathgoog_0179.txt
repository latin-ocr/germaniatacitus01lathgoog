In Gothic archaeology it ie well known that the socalled metallis
age is separated from the eccelled αοιοοιειοὶιίο by a broad line of
demaroation3 the series of facts upon which the distinction reete

anterior ,to the practice of metallurgy being contrasted with that
which arose out of the introduction of that art. One of the more
important hypotheses connected with this distinction has been eo
