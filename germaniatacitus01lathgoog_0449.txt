Iu this case, Chattuarii is the Low German form of anama
of the Marsi and others, taken from the forest district they
occupied—just as numerous minor tribes might be called
Hercynio, or Bononio, from the Hercyniam or Bormiae
foreste.

But it may also iudicate a settlement of intmsive Ghettr'
from Hace, and the name be newer than the population.

Ι incline to the former ol these views; still admittiug the
difficulty involved in the fact of populations with names so
like as Olea-uarii (= oeci-oola), Olus-uarii (occupauts ol the
Here), and Orate (occupante of Hesse) being so-called‚ inde-
pendeut of any special connection.

The hypothesis that the ailoe Casia was a common rather
thau a proper name, aud, as such, one whioh might occur in
more districts than oue, would solve the difficulty. The
solution, however, is, at best, but hypothetieal. If valid‚
however, Herae itself might be buta ailoe aaa, just as
Barpandy wasa Virpant.

Hence, the Chattuarii wera High Germane or Low Ger·
mans, according to the view we take of the origin of their
name. Or they may have been modifled High Germane-
High Germane in origin, but Low Germana in locality, aud
several other characteristica.

We have seen that, although the word Chattuarii is not
the Low German form for the Olea-uarii of the Haeo, it is
something of the kind. lt ie the Low German name of the
Haza-carii of Escae, and the parts about that town.

If Low Germane, they were, probably, Platt·Deutsch
rather thau Saron, and Frisian rather thau Plett-Deutsch-
the reasouing running thus :-

o. Their hostility to the Saxeus is evidence, as far ae it
goes, for the two populations belonging to different divisione.

Chattuarian area, were Frisiaus.-“Frieiooea qui vocantur
