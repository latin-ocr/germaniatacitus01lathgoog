The third chapter has servcd tc illustrate the principles of
ethnolcgical classificaticn; since it has shown that natione as
different as the lcelander and the Swiss may be comprized
in one general division 3 in other words that a stook comprises
populations as different from each other as the Bavarians, the
Dutch, the Swedes, the Farce lslanders and the Americans
of the United States. Hence the Gothic stoclr is one of the
stocks of which we have a pretty clear ides.

Another such astech is the Classical. This comprises the
Latius end Greeks-ancient and modern. Besides which it,
to a certain extent, comprises the Spaniards, the Portu-
guese, the French, certain Swiss populatione, and the Wal-
lachians3 in all ef which countries the languageis derived from
the Latin 3 the population being mixed, ia, partly consisting
of Roman, partly of aboriginal blood. Now, recognising the
great Classical stoelr as an ethnological equivalent to the
Gothic, and comparing the extent to which a Wallachian
differs from an Italian cr a modern Greek of the other, vve
have a convenient measure of the impert of the word neck,-
sincc we see the amount of difference implied by it.

toriccl pencd, hes retrectat before the Genunnic rather than cncronched on it.
