In denying the name Ga to be native to the Goth-iai,

ιΙ lassume that there is no special evidence in favour of its

being so; and such 1 believe to ba tbe ease.

In affirming the same name to be native to the Goth-ones,
I am prepared with evidence.

Is the name which in Tacitus takes the form cedmae
native or foreign? known to the tribes to which it applies, or
as strange to them as the term Welsd is to Cambriani This
is not answered in the reasoning upon the word anull,-
sinee it by no means follows that because one ont of two
names given to a country is undoubtedly foreign, the other
is necessarily indigenous. The feet of the term Gothorum
being indigenous is not a legitimate inference from the exotic
character of the neme AEslll. J nst as the latter designation
was German, the former may bave been Slavonic; and the
one may have been as unlike the real native name as the
other.

Praetorius, a Pole, writing nn. 1688, in his Orbis Gothicus,
devotas two sections to the following questions :-

“ An reliquiae nominis Gothioi in terris Europeae Sarmatiae
reperiantur?

“ Unde nominis Gadda contemptus hodie in Pmssia 3”

From these we leam that the Samogitiens, Russiens,
Lithuanians, Prassians, Zalavonians, Nadravians, Natravians,
Sudovians, Mazovians, and the inhabitants of Dueal Prnssia
were called Gunnons by the people about Koningsberg, and
that this neme was a nome os contenrpl, accounted for hythe
extent to which the populations to which it applied, bad
retained their paganism against the efforts of the propagatore
of the Prussian Christianity. “ Gnddarum infidelium nomen
existit, adeo ut Gothus sive chdae idem iis qui paganus et
ethnicus, hostisque Christianitatis audienti*

That it was also Slavonic is shown hy a line from an old
Tshekh (Bohemian) poem.
