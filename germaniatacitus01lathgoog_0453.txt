lxxiv THE GERM.lNY OF unctius

the middle of the third century* to the present day, tho root
Such, or Saso, has been s natine German namo for the
Germana os Sandis. Before this, we hear of Saevi, but their
locality is not Stadia

What does this prove! That Saso- was a German name
previously? By no means. It merely proves that s certain
area was called by the Romans attera population named
Saevi, and that certain Germana who settled there took their
trama from the area. Kent, at the present moment, is English,
aad the Kent-inps who occupied part· of it during the Anglo·
Sason period were English. But does this make Kent an
English wordl No. It isBritish= Cant-ium, as is well-known.

Up to the tima in question (ia, the reign of Alexander),
the known facts are quite as much against Seso- being a
German root as in favour of it. Oaesar's aas are described
by Gaulo, and Tacitus's are in a looality which st one and the
same time is different from Casar's, and Skroonic. No one,
who has realized the extent to which natioual names vary
with the language of the informante, will say that the root
Saso, as applied to the subjeets of Ariovistus, may not he

as oaelnsiosly Gallio, as the word Wslslt is melanosly
Germanic.

Hence, up to the time in question, Saenia is simply the
name of the country of a population that the Romans and
Kelts called Soreoi—a population which need not even ba
Germanic, still less, necessarily, call themselves by Sese.

ff This is allowing the term Suetus, as applied to cenain populations and
individuale (eg, Ricimer) bytho Latin writers, an excessivo extension. 'l'he
same authors would heve called Hengist, hed such a personage been in Κοωο,
aBriton. Yet he was no such thing. SuchaOheruscan, too, as the bro-
ther ol Arminius, would also have been called Gmnanus. Yet such s name
was strange to the individual himself. Similsrly, Englishmen eall Prinee
Albcrt a German, aad (perhaps) in speaking English he calls himself so.
Yet lte is a Deutsele. These remarks are necessary, since the render cannot
too clearly see that the question is not whether certain Saevi were Germane,
but whether such Germane called themselves Sueoi. However, as the argu-
ment is put in its strongest form, the objection is not pressed: otherwise
the trrdy uncxceptionable evidence ol Saeu- being a German root, bagins
when the Germana of Suebis, uncquirocnlly speaking ol themselves, in their
own language eall themselves Sueten. This is much later.
