³ Osi.]-No other writer but Tacitus ansgerioocally mentions any
tribe with aname like that eloai, in the neighbourhood os the
south-eastern March. The Otii of Ptolemy are too lar north to
coincide with them. These are a psopls beyond the Veltae (Οὑέλται),
ahithuanic nation on the Baltic—Ile‘hw δὲ τὴν μὲν ἐφεξῆς τῷ
Οὑενεδικῷ κόλπῳ παρωκεανῖτιν κατέχουσιν Οὒίλται, ὑπὲρ οὓς Ὅσιοι,
εἶτα Κάρέωνες ἀρκτικὼτατοις a people whose name Zenss is probably
right in connecting with that of the island Osilia=0ezel.-P. 272.

Isay that no writer but Tacitus utaequivocolly mentions any tribe
with a name lilre that ol the Osi, in the neighbourhood os the south-
eastern March; and 1 now dmw attention to the qualisying word
coequioooolly. What if the Οῢῖσξούργιοι be the people 'of Obla-
ξουργ-, as they almost certainly ποτε, and Oblcdoopy- be the burg or
berg( ol the Osil

Whethet· the ·βουργ- in Obiedodpyeos=berq=hild or bqub=
boroogla, sie, whether the oompound be a word like Konings·berg‚ or
aword like Ham-burg, is of no great consequence. the word isa
German one. Yet it by no means follows that the nation it desig-
nated was German.

Wisburq (or stbery) might be a German name for a Slaronic
locality‚ just as Liestond (Liuentis) and Gortrland are.

It might also (as suggested in p. 97), in the hands ol a Greek
writer, talre the form Asciburgius Mons.

That the oe· were not German is Tacitus’s own statement.

The complement to this note is not. in vr. Arauisci ab osu-oe·
oh Araviscis, p. 96, dic.

The hypothesis is as follows :-

o. That the populatiou l'rom the Asciburgium M oras, or the Carpa-
thians between Gallicis, Moravia, and Upper Hungary, was once
continuous with that of Oroatia ς the northern portion of it being
called, by the Germans, Osi.

b. The invasion of the Germana ol the Danube broke up this
continuity.

o. But not wholly. Within the German area (probably in the
mountain strongholds of the huno Siloo=JcblunJco Bes-9), isolated
portione oi the Osi preserved their language.

⁴ Barim-What applies to the Marsigni applies to the Buris'.
They may be considered German as long as there is no stronger
objection lying against them than their situation beyond the March,
