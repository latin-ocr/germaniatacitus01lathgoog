2. The Oroatians-themselres the speakers of a langnage
which extends, with but few variations of dialect, from the
Adriatic to the Euxine—the language of the Montenegrino
mountaineers on the frontier ot* Albania, the Dalmatiam, the
Herzegovinians, the Bosuiacs‚ the serviens, the southern
Hungarians, the Slavonians of Slavonia attho junction of the
Save and Danube, and the Bulgarians.

The Slavonic languages, like the Germanic, mnst bc studied
in respect to their history as well as their geographical
distribution-in respect to time as well as ploce. In this
respect, the fact which bas tbe most important application is
connected with the southern division of them. lt was in a

Servian, Oroatian, or Dalmatian, dialect tbat Christianity was · .

first preached, and tha first scriptural translations made.
Hence, the so·called old Slavonic has thesaure importanee in
Russian and Servian philology as the Moesooothic has in
German.

The northern frontier of the south-Slavonic area is formed
by a line running through Styria, Southern Hungary, and the
northern part of Bulgaria; the southern frontier of the
northern by Bobemia, Moravia, Gallicia, Volbynis, and Podo-
lia; the intermediate aon-Slavonic countries being Hungary,
Wallacbia, and Moldavia.

The Hungarians, or Majiars, are of Finnie origin, and
constitute an intrusive population, tho date of their intrusion
being the tenth century.

The Wallacbians, Moldavians, and Bessarabians are par-
tially at least ol Latin origin, and, so far as they arc so,
they constitute, like the Majiars‚ an intrusive population,
the date of their intrusion being the second century, io, the
time ot' Trajan tho conqueror of Dacia.

We have seen that, in respect to their geographical dis·

tribution‚'ths Russians, Peles, and Bohernians, belong to
one division, the Serviane and Slavonians to another. Is
