One of the marginal notes is the following oouplet.-

“ Quem modo polluerat cultura nefaris dudum
Gallus monticulum huno tibi oua tulit,”

uhieh, in the Augsburg (lhroniole, appears in the body of the
extract

It may, then, be safely said that, in the thirteenth oentury, the
memory of alooal goddess, named Zisa, was preserved in the neigh-
bourhood of Augsbur33 and, although the parts about that city
were, strictly speaking, Vindelics'oa rather than Suelio, it may fairly
he supposed that the cedrus extended into the true Soeoio area.

The following feet diminishes the difficulties involved in the
differenoe of form between Ins and Ziza

o„ Meisterlin, who wrote about en. 1456, has the form with
the final ·s‚ “ Oeae-der gdttinn Uise, die auoh genent vird Ossae?
This aooounts for the final a.

h. The form Eposo ooours. (irimm quotes the expression, “der
amazonisohen Augspurger japetisoh frew Eyuu’'

ht the same timo, it should be remembered thet the writers who
spealr of Fron Eposo, may hare been disposed to the adoption
of that form from the name Isis in 'l'aoitna Hence the evidence
in favour of the omission of the initial 0 or Z, is not unexoep-
tionable.

'lhat the present text intluenoed the riews of the later writers
oonoeruing the Augsburg goddess, is oertsin; suoh a phenomenon
being by no means unusual 3 sinos numerous instanoes oould be
sdduoed to show that an inaoourote aooount of a superstition in an
influential writer, has noted upon the superstition itself-just as
certain propheeies fullil their own aooomplishment

At any rate, in the sixteenth oentury, we find Fron Isis with
certain attributes, which may fairly he oonsidered as foreign, and
superadded to those of Cina. Some of these are deduoibls from the
notioe of Tacitus 3 others refersble to other sources of oonfusion.
Thus, Jesn le Maire, writing nn. 1512, says, “Au temps dnquel
lo deesse Isis, royne d'AEgypte vient en Allemaigne et monimen
rude peuple l’usaige de mouldro la farine et faire du pain.”

Arentin (about nn. 1522) says that it was from Frow anm, that
ison (German edm) took its name, adding en sooount of her nsum,

wherein mention is made of the skip, and Heroides is said to hove
been her sathon-See 1). M. i. 244.
