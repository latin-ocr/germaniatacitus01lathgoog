This must be read along vvith ᾗῇ xn. aud xus.

The Wcrro was a river ol Thuringia, which it divided from
Saxouy.

α. Unleas we suppose either that the river Womow effected
a migration-

ὀ. 0r that it took its name from the Varini, who did so—

c. 0r that there was a colonial settlement-

We must suppose thatthe population took its name from the
river, that Worivti meant the pcople of the Werro, and that
the two populations were as nuconnccted as the two rivers.

But the names ol different rivers being so like, as Wovrc is
to Waraow, is against the chauces. ’

And the two Aegle localities are so as well.

And the contiguity of the Angles of the Elbe to the Varini,
taken with that of the Angles of Thuringia to the Werini,
is still more so.

Still the names of the rivers are facts which we must take
as we find; since the circumstance of a river taking its name
from its occupeuts is as rare ee the converse is common,
especially amongst the Slavonic populations.

Even if we assume a colonication like that of the Otumooi
and Chattuarii, the difficulty is only dimiuished; since it
would still be strange that the people of the War-now should
be removed to a locality with a name sc near their own as
the Wevra.

Worrc may possibly, like Oooc and Acon, have been a
name that, from being a common rather than a proper one,
recurs in different places.

Still, the difficulty of the relation of the Arsgli end Woriui
