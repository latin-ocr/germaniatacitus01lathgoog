EPILEGOMENA. xxxvii

mitted be a real one, otherwise, the tradition is only the
tradition ol an opinion, aa.. no tradition at all.

A tradition, too, must be different from aa insererer.
All traditione rtur ooiaor'de with iafhrenoea are suspirans,- or
(ehanging the expression), all infirmare waiet piae aa the
some results aa a tradition weokea its aalidity (aa, that of the
tradition).

This, perhaps, requires illustration.

In England there existed, at the time of Beda, three
populations; one ealled Anyti, one Saxones, and one some

times Jatae, but oftener Vtra. In Hampshire, the Saaoaea = ι

and Vtra, or Jarae, came in contaet.

similarly, in the parts about the Lower Elbe and
Eyder, there existed three similarly-named populations;
oue called Anyti, one Senarus, and oue sometimes Vita, but
oltener Jatae. In Sleswiek the daroma and Jarae, or Vtra,
eante in contact.

Now Beda writes that the Jara of England oame from
the Jurae of Jntland; and hia statement generally (perhaps
universally) is supposed to rest ou either history or tradition.

lbeliera it to rest on neither the one nor the other. l
believe it to be an infersam-an insererem so logically correct,
that I only wonder at the combination of ohanoes whieh
mahe it actually wrong.

N evertheless, the truth was as follows. The people of the Isle
ol Wight were called Vita, evan as the people of Jutland were.

And, the people of the lale of Wight, thas called, lay in
geographieal eontaet with certain Saxons; those Saxona being
iu similar eontaet with certain Angles. All this was also
the oasa with the Jatlanders.

Such coincidenees wanted aoeouuting for. A migration
did this; aud a migration was inserrod

The extent to which the similarity of name between Gothi

and Geta might engender a similar inferenter, similarly resem-
bling a tradition, weakens the historieal lihelihood of the
truth ol J ornandes' aoeount.

Such are some of the reasons for considering his derivation
of the Germana (or Goths) of the Danube from the shores of
the Baltie, as highly exeeptiouable.
