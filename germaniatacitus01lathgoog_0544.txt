Of Appiae the whole evidence goes one way, oia, that the

tribes in question were Gauls. His expressions are: πλεῖ· ,

στον τε καὶ μαχιμώτατον-χρῆμα Κελτῶν εἰς τὴν Ἰταλίαν
καὶ τὴν Γαλατίαν siciliam—iv. 2. ln his book on lllyria
hastatos, that the Kelts and Cimbri, along with the Illyriae
tribe of the Antariae, had, previous to the battle against
Marius, attached Delphi and suffered sor their impiety.
-Ἰλλυρ. δ’. 4.

Quintilian may be considered to give us upon the subject
the notione of two writers—Virgil, end either Caesar or
Crassus. In dealing, however, with the words of Quintilian,
it will be seen thet there are two assumptione. That either
Caesar or Crassus considered the Cimbri to be Gauls, we inser
from the following passage: ‘⁶ Rarum est antem, ut oculis
subjicere contingat (sc. vituperationem), ut fecit C. Julius, qui
cum Helvio Manciae saepius obstrepenti sibi diceret, jam osteo·
dam, qualib sis: isque plane instaret interrogatione, qualem
se tandem ostensurus esset, digito demonstravit imaginem
Colli iu scuto Mariano Cimbrico pictam, eni Mancia tum
simillimus est visus. Tabernae autem erant circum Forum, ac
scutum illud signi gratia positum.”-Inst. Orat. vi. 3, 38.
Pliny tells the story of Crassus (xxxix. 4). Although in this
passage the word upon which the argument turns hasbeen
written galli, end translated coeti, the current interpretation is
the one given above—Vid. not. ed. Gesner.

ln the same author is preserved the epigram of Virgil's
called Catalecta, and commented ou by Ausonius of Bordeaux.
Here we learn that T. Annius Cimber was a Ganl; whilst it
is assumed that there was no other reason to believe that he
was called Cimber than that of his being descended from
some slave or frecdman of that nation:—“ Nou appareat
affectatio, in quam mirifice Virgilius,

Corinthiorum amator iste verborum

llle iste rhetor: namque quotenus totus
Thucydides Britannus, Attica febres,
Tou-Gallicum, min, sl· spinae male illisit.
lta omnis ists verba miscuit fratri.

Cimber hic fuit a quo fratrem necatum hoc Ciceronis dictum
