which ie a name applied not to all uouSlavonio natione in·
differently, but to those of the Uyriou etoek oreph-see
Prokpom. p. xlix.

But this restriction of its application to a single non·
Keltio population is by no means neceesary; since the word
is quito as likely to be in the predicament of the Germanic
term werse, as inibat of the Slavonio Tslrud‚· the word
Welsh being applied not only by the English of England
ιο their fellow-oitizens of the principality‚ but hythe Ger-
mane of Germany ιο the Italicos ol' Italy.

Now what if Suco- be really a root like wecil, im, a root
applicahle to two (or more) reon-Koltio populatione, indepen-
dently of their relatione to each other, and with reference ιο
the noo-Keltioism onlyl And what if the second of these
populations were the ulamau?

If euch be thesseo, mors thau one difficulty would find ite
solution.

In the first place, it would account for so many Slavonic
populatione being designatcd as Saevi.

In the second, it would supply a plausible origin for the
word itself.

The phonetic systems of the Slavonic and Keltic, each so
peculim, are each sufficiently different to make such a root as
Surb, sore, or Sero (the nativo ,designation of the Slavo-
nians), take in the mouth of a Gaul, the form Suae, Such, or
Suae—and such I believe ιο have been the case.

Of course, this view requires ιο be supported by evidence,
that the Kelte lead a name sor the Slavonians at all; and
(although the present ie not the place where it will be ex·
hihited) ench evidence ean be given. The hypothesis also
requires that this name, as the designationes a uoreKeltic
population, should have been given to a Slavonic nation first.
I think that thie also can be made probable. If so, .we must

suppose that the south-eastern Gauls, and the most western
of the Saxon and Thuringian Slavonians once met ; that the
native Slavonio name derb took in Gaul the form Suom
that certain Germanic populatione displaced those Slavonians,
and thus came in contact with Kelts ;—laetly‚ that the name
