mitted be a real oue; otherwise, the tradition is only the
tradition of au opinion, io.. no tradition at all.

A tradition, too, must be different from an iafhreace.
Ait traditione atat rancide witi iafhrences ara auspicium or

tradition).

This, perhaps, requires illustration.

Iu England there existed, at the time of Beda, three
populations; one called Awyli, one Saeuam, and one some-

times Jutae, but oftener Vitae. ln Hampshire, the Saaortes · .

and Vitoe, or Jutae, came in contact.

similarly, in the parts about the Lower Elbo and
Eyder, there existed three similarly-named populations;
one called Angli, one Secoaos, and one sometimes Vitae, but
oltener Jarae. ln Sleswiclr the Saawtea and Jatae, or Vita,
came iu contact.

Now Beda writes that tho Jotae of England came from

the Jatae of Jutland; and his statement generally (perhaps

universally) is supposed to rest ou either history or tradition.

lbelieve it to rest on neither the one nor the other. l
believe it to be an icfereaca-an informa so logioully correct,
that I only wonder at the combination of chauces which
urahe it actually wrong.

N evertheless, the truth was as follows. The people of the Isle
of Wight were called Vita, even as the people of Jctland were.

And, the people of the Isle of Wight, thus called, lay in
geographieal contaot with certain Sancum those Saxone being
in similar contaot with certain Angles. All thie was also
the case with the Jntlanders.

Such coincidenoes wanted accounting for. A migration
did this3 and a migration was iasarred.

The extent to which the similarity ol' name between Gottt
and Geta might engender a similar infiscare, similarly resem-
bling a tradition, wealrens the historical likelihood of the
truth of J ornaudee' account.

Such are some of the reasons for considering his derivation
ol' the Germans (or Goths) of the Danube from the shores ol
the Baltic, as lriglrly exceptionablc.
