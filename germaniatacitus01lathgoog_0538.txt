of any intermediate portion of that area being possessed by
tribes as alien ιο each other aethe Gauls and Germana Hence,
therefore, the fact of the Cimbri being Kelts will (if proved)
be considered as making against the probability of their origin
in the Cimbris Chersonese; whilst, if they be shown ιο be
Gothe, the difficulties of the suppositiou will be in some degree
diminiabed. Whichever way this latter point is settled, some·
thing will be gained for the historiam since the supposed
presence of Kelts in the Cimbric Chersoneso has complicated
more than one question in ethnography.

Provious to proceeding iu the inquiry, it may be well ιο lay
down, once for all, as a postulate, that whatever, in the way
of ethnography, is proved consemiug any one tribe ot' the
Cimbro-Teutonic league, must be considered as proved con-
cerniug the remaiuder; since all explanatione, grounded upon
the idea that one part was Gothic and another part Keltic‚
beve a certain amount of primd socie improbability to set
aeide. The same conditione as to tbe burden of proof apply
also ιο any hypothesis founded ou the uotion of retiriny Cimbri
posterior to the attempted invasion of Italy. On this point
the list of authors quoted will not be brought below the time
of Ptolemy. With the testimonies anterior to that writer,
bearing upon the question of the ethnography, the attempt,
however, will be made to be exhaustive. Furthermore, as the
questionis hand iauot so much the absolute fact as ιο whe-
ther the Cimbri were Kelts or Gotho, but one aa ιο the amount
of evidence upon which we believe thern to be either the one
or the other, statementa will be noticed under the head of
evidence, not because they are really proofs, but simply
because they have ever been looked upon as such. Beginuing
then with the Germanic origin of the Cimbro-Teutonis confe-
deratiou, and dealing separately with such tribes as are sepa-
rately mentioned, we first find the

Ambraciae—Iu the Aegle-Saxon poem called the Traveller’s
song, there is a notice of a tribe called Ymdre, lelrar, or
Ymdraa. Suhm, the historian of Denmark‚ has allowed him-
self ιο imagine that these represent the Ambrosios, and that
their names still exista in that of the island Amroa of the
coast ol Sleswiclr, aud perhaps in Amerhrnd a part of Olden-
