l. Alco, that they were the Φρουιγουνδίωνες ol Ptolemy.

ο. Alco, the Otipovyorivbot of Zosimus.

d. Alco, the Βοοροῦγουνδοι ol' Agathias.

ι. Possibly the Bolyoriooe oi the later historiens.

They were occupante of the parts east of the Upper Vis-
tuln, or between the Vistula and Bug. They were well-
known to the Greek writers of the Byzantius empire; and
the only question concamiug them is, whether they were
Scythiam 01· Ham-Obrue δὲ ἅπαντες κοινῇ μὲν Σκύθαι καὶ
Οὖννοι ἐπωνομάζοντο· ἰδίᾳ δὲ κατὰ γένη, τὸ μέν τι αὐτῶν
Κοτρύγουροι, τὸ δὲ Οὖτὺγουροι, ἄλλοι δὲ Οὒλτίζουροι, καὶ
ἄλλοι Βουρούγουνδοι. . . αὐτίκα γοῦν Οὐλτίζουροί τε καὶ
Βουροῦγουνδοι μέχρι μὲν Λέοντος τοῦ αὖτοκράτορος καὶτῶν
ἐν τῷ τότε Ῥωμαίων γνώριμοι τε ὑπῆρχον καὶ ἄλκιμοι
εἶναι ἐδόκουν· ἡμεῖς δὲ οἱ νῦν οὔτε ἴσμεν αὐτοὺς, οὔτε, οἶμαι,
εἰσόμεθα, τυχὸν μὲν διαφθαρέντος, τυχὸν δὲ ὡς ποῤῥωτάτω
paraveredorum—Agathos, V· ll·

Still the similarity of the name is remarkable.

Considering, however, that their neighbours ou the south
were the Gotho of the Danube, that the name is by no means
moesearily native, that their country was the water-sled of
the Vistula and Bug, and that scirpooi=lill ¹ in Gothic, it is
by no means unlikely that, different as were the natione, these
names may hare been the same, ela, the German form for
Hlyhlaoder. Still it is quito ae likely ιο be accidentnl; and,
if the Borupoodi of the Bug were schanan, ie so.

But the difficulty does not end here. Ptolemy has, besides
his Φροιηουνδίωνεε, a population called Bouporlvrar.

o. The Αἰλουοίωνες (Helveconae, see note in· voc.) lay
between the ‘Povrlxheeor and tho Bovycovroe.

b. The Lepti Omani carne ὑπὸ τοὺς Βουγούντος.

ι. The Βουιγούντοι came east of the Semnones, from the
river Snebns (Σοῦηέος) ιο the Vistula.

These arc very difficolt conditione. At first it appears that
we must separate the Βοιιγούντοι from the Φρονγουνδίωνει,
because Ptolemy mentione both; and that we must consider
the former to be the Boryuodt'oos ol Franconia, because
Ptolemy does not mention these latter.
