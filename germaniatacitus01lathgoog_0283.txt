tion, and, as such, have failed in attracting notice, or developing a
name. -

Ptolomy's notice of the populations whose name end in -bosd
(and in Ptolemy there are two such) introduces a difficulty.

He first places Langobardi (Aoyyoto'pior) vest and south of the
Anglisn Suevi (Σοοῆξοι oi Ἀγγειλοι), these latter being on the
hliddls Elbo

Altervards he places Λακκοιᾶρδοι between the Chauci hlsjores
and tha Saevi, conterminous vith the Angrivarii snd Dulgubini
(Δουλγοῦμνιοι).

This complication may, possibly, appear unimportent 3 so that
the inquirer may, perhaps, think himself justified in disposing of it
at onos by assuming either an error in the reading, or an oversight
in the author. Possibly, this view is right. N sverthsloss, it is by no

means necessarily so. The vord in question is acompound, os which
the qualifying clement comes first. Hence, it is lar from impossible

that whilst Langobardi means mea uses borda (beords or talieta as
the case may be) of one sort, Lokkobordi may mean mm usu barris

(uam, dvo.) of another. Troe it is that tho elements Laep- and
nats ars suspiciously slihe ,· neither oan any satisfactory meaning be
given to the latter word. N evortheless, the inference of their being
the same vord is far lrom conclusive. (lompound words may be
aliha and yet different ς as are Wessea and Esses.

Zeuss gives a lull, perhaps an excessivo, impert ιο this differenoe,
considering that the Bokkotardi were not only the subsequent con·
querors of Italy under Alboin (which the langobardi were not)
but that Ptolemy knovvingly and intentionslly distinguished between
the two-“ Disss Σοοῆέοι konnen also nicht mit den Langobarden,
den Eroberem Italiens, veruechselt worden 3 Ptolemaeus selbst,
soheint cs, will sis untsrsohieden nissen, dass ordisse, die schon in
getrennten Sitzen ausgestellt sind, obvohl ihr name derselbe ist,
such verschisden Aorsoto'piot benenno”-p. 95.

Agnis-“Mt den Σουῆξοι Λαγγοέἄρδοι dos Ptolemaeus diirl'cn
nicht verwechselt werden seins Λακκοιάρδοι, thc.”—p. 109.

Itis doubtful, however, whether Ptolomy's own text requires this
distinction ιο be thus stringently insisted on, ie, if ve take the
Aegri-uarii to be the centro for our inquiries, and admit Enqem ιο
represent their locality.--See § xxxiii.

Thus-o. The ceu Langobardi are conterminous vith the
Bructeri Minores (Boeotimpos oi μικροί) and the Segasnbri. Οἱ
