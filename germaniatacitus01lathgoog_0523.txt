Such the difficulties attending the doctrine ot' an original
conticuity os arec aad obsequar diaphrcemeat.

The other alternative, or that of simple migraticn, requires
three facte to be borne in mind-

a. That it is no further from the Dardanclles tc the Indus
thau from the Indus tc the Dardanellee.

d. Tbat the real conqueets of Alexander (especially that
which led to the establishment of the Greek kingdom of

Bactria) differed from such a European conquest ae ie neces- ,

sary to account for all the pheucmena cf the Sanskrit and
allied languages iu date, magnitude, and duraticn only—ha,
in degree though not in kiad.

c. That the Majiar conquest of Hungary differs only in
date; for, certainly, it would be a bold statement to assert
that a similar conquest of an area cl equal magnitude on the
Indus, on the part of the Europeane of Thrace aud the
Lowcr Danube, at a sufficieutly early date, would not account
for all the points of likeness between the Hindu and tbe
European. The likclihcod ol such an event happeniug, is
measured by the actual conquesta of the Macedoniam.

Such is the balance of the difficulties of the two hypotheses;
the conclusion in the mind ol the present writer being that if
we consider the Sanslrrit to bc Asiatia in the way that the

Majiar ie European, we escape the unneceesary multiplicatiori
cl causes, and arcid assumptione of which the number and
amount hae never been fairly measured.
How far the Jaa of ludia arc Get-a, is a difficult question.
The magnitude of the arca iu which the coincidence occurs
ie quite large enough to allow us to consider it occidental.
still, a case may bc made out the other way.
