PROLEGOMENA. XXXV

osmod, is scientifioally correct. What Tacitus knew of the
Germane of the south was, that they extended as far down
the Danube as the frontier of Pannonia (say, the parts about
Pesth); aud be had no reason to imagine that their southem
extension went one hair’s-breadth further in an easterly
direction than did their northern one, or uice ceroci. Hence,
the extension of their area, as far along the Baltic as it was
known to reach along the Danube, was legitimate: subject,
of course, to correction from further investigation; and
equally legitimate was the assumption that the Ligii and
other populations of the interveniug parts were German-since
the reasoning ran thus-

a. The southern Germane run thus lar eastwards.

b. The northern do the same.

o. So do the parts interjacent. Subject, Ι say, to correction
from absolute investigation this a priori view was strictly
scientific; and who shall say that 'l'aoitus put it forth uncou-
ditionallyt

Again-had the Baltic been even less German than it
actually was, it was only through Germana that it was known
to tho Greeks aad Romans: what, then, was more natural
thau that the extent ol the German sea-board upon it should
be over-valuedl Like the present Danes with their oocupancy
of the Sound‚ their prominence exceeded their occupancy.

These aud similar consideratione show that such inaccu-
raoies as we find in Tacitus are, so far from subtracting from
his value as an authority, or from the respect due to his tes-
timony, that they enhanoe his credit. Such as occur oould
hardly have been avoided ; aud the only wonder is that there
aro so few of them.

If, however, we deny this reasonable amount of inaccuraoy,
the thoroughly hypothetical character of the migratione in
question cannot be too strongly stated, or too prominently
exhibited. They are referable to one head, and to ono head
only, aiz„ the facts which they will explain. In and of
themselves they are wholly unsupported-unsupported with-
out, however, lying beyond the pale of observation. Tha
countriee to which they appertain were known (at least)

well enough for 'l'acitus aud others to write aboutd.2 The
