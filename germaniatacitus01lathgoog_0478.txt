And, also, that a chief with the Turk name Aspar* (perhaps
a Τυνοῖῖῖνιρῖυο) took part in their politics :-‘' Οτι Σκῖροι καὶ
Γὸτθοι εἰς πόλεμον συνελθόντες καὶ διοχωρισθέντες ἆμ-
φότεροι πρὸς συμμάχων μετάκλησιν παρεσκευάζοντο· ἐν
οῖς καὶ παρὰ τοὺς ἑῴους ἦλθον. Καὶ Ἄσπορ μὲν ἡγεῖτο
μηδετέροις συμμαχεῖν, o' δὲ αὐτοκράτωρ Λέων ε’ἓούλετο
Σκίροις ἐπικουρεῖν. Kal δὴ ιγράμμιῖτο πρὸς τὸν ἐν Ἰλλυριοῖς
στρατηγὸν ἔπεμπεν, ἔντελλόμενός σφισιν κατὰ τῶν Γὸτθων
βοήθειαν τὴν προσήκουσαν adhaesa-Prisci Rhet. F ragm.
ed. Bonn. p. 160.

It is, then, not wholly improbable that the Scirc‘ and
Τυνοῖῖῖιιρῖ may have been Tartar the first, perhaps, of that
stoclr that penetrated far into Europe. luc aaa, alter their
misfortunes having been reduced in power, became subject to
Gothic leaders, and, finally lixed, as a military colony, in
Styria (Smper-mark, or the Mur-cll of tto Styri).

The notion that Hirri=Sciri is confirmed hythe form
Σκίῤῥοι in Procopius, Bell. Goth. i. 1ε-Σιιῖῤῥους καὶ Ἀλά-
νους καὶ ἄλλο ἅττα Γότθικο lory.

But how are we to account for the Satri of Pliny, placed
by that writer sofar north as Ιῶιῖιιρῖυ, probably Fmalayio=
the Fica country Ξ We may suppose him ιο have lain under
the same mistalre with Tacitus in respect to thedistance between
the parts about the Gulf cf Riga and the Lower Danube, and
to have made it less than it really was. Hence, as Tacitus
(Germt xcvi.) brings the Peucini and Bastarna ιοο naar the
Fruar· and Venedi, Pliny does the sarna with the Sciri.

It may be added that, amongst the members of the Huc
consederacy, no clement, in words apparently compound, is
more common than the combination ofrenda compound
sibilant (ab, οι, at, dzt); and (as a consequence of this) no
terminationis more common amongst Hun nations than that
of -νυνῖ, -οιῖνῖ, dre.

That this compound sibilant is just tha combination which
is rendered sometimes by sk, and sometimes by st, as is
suggested in not. ad ν. Νονῖοοῖ.

Thus, amongst the names which no writer has ever mado

⁶ This ir also an Isaurica name.
