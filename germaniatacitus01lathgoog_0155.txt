Danube takes its great bend southwards, and separatos the eastern
Pannoniam from the J azyges. The parts os the chscavb of Tacitus
which reacb the Pannonian part of the Danube, coincide with the
present country of Upper Hungmy, or the valleys of the Gran aud
Waag.

The langueges here spoken are, at the present moment referable
to three families‚-l. German in Lower dustria, and on the eide
of Lower dustria. 2. Slavonic on the side of Styria, Oroatia, and
Slavouia 3. Majiar, or Proper Hungarian in the central parts.

The present population of Pannonia cannot but be extremely
mixed, since, sverand above the present occupante, there have been
successive invasione ol Romans, Goths, Hune, Arare, Gumanians, and
Gepidoe. All this complicates the inquiry as to the ethnological
position ol the original ante-Roman Pannonicus.

At the sometime, by eliminating those elementa, which we know
to have been of recent introduction, we approach the question.

of these two have occurred within the historical period.

The Germane ot Lower Austris are the Germane of Upper dustria
advanced eastwards, and the Germane of Upper dustria are the
Germane of Bavaria similarly protrudsd. Their language ie refer·
able to the Alemannic type ; their original ancestors were probably
Alemanni, and the date ol their occupancy is not earlier than the
fourth century.

'Phe Majiars are even of later introduction, and their advent even
more within the range of history. It took place in the tenth century.

The Goths, Hune, dvm, Cumaniaus, have all occupied parts of
Pannonia-bnt all within the historical period, or nearly so. 'Phe
aborigines preceded all these.

'lhe original population of Pannonia must be arrived at bytho ec-
clcsiae cactlwd, tc, the elimination of all kaoua recent populations.

Now the population that remeius after this ie that of the Shvaks
of Upper Hungary, who are Slavoniane.

'Phe ethuology of those parts of Pannonia which was not German
is no partos the present work. Many reasons, however, beyond
the existence ol the Slovaks could be given for making it Sla-
vonran.

dt the same tirno, there ie but little doubt that the banks of the
Danube were occupied by imrusicc Germane at an carly period.
