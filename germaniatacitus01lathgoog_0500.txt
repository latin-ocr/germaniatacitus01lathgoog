EPILEGOMENa. cxxi

reason against the Aviones having been F risione, but no
reason against their having been Old Saxone.

But against this is Ptolemy's name Κοδανδοί, and the
KoGavhot' lie northwards.

3. Whether the Eudoses are the same aethe Φουνδούσιοι
(see not. in § xc.) is not a matter of indifference. By identifying
them, we ascertain the direction, if not the exact locality of
the Eudoses. This is nortlwards, in the western partos the
Gimbrio Peniusula.

t. Whether the nuaram are the same as the Φαρό-
δεινοι (see notin §xnt is still less a matter ol indiffereuce. By
identifying them we ascertain the directior, if not the exact
locality‚ of the Sacerdotem. This is wotoards between the
saetas and the Oholuaoa (Odere and Trave t). But then we
get a complication; since Scard— is generally considered to
be a German root, whereas the locality is Slaronian.

That Grrl is really a German root is rendered probable by
the form Sweord-wercjn the Traveller's Song. But this only
makes it a German gloss. That it applied to a German
population by no means follows. No word is more German
than Welsh, few populations less so.

5. In the name Reudicpt the Rand- may, possibly, be the
Htw, in Hreoootans. Now the Hrat-Gotoo were Litha-
amans.

6. On the Nuithones I cau throw uo light at alh-not even
in the way of guess-work and suggestion.

lf we leave Tacitus and betake ourselves to Ptolemy, we
gain a little. Iu Ptolemy we not only get the names of
certain populations, but we get their looality (or at least
their direction) also. But they are almost all new, and other-
wise unknown, Sipuloraca Sohilinpii, olata.

Upon the whole, Ι think that the Angli of Tacitus were the
only representativea enumerated by him, of the Angla-Saxou
branch of the Saxona-unless the Nuithones be a second.

Of the others, l think that :—

o. Where their direction was eaeterly, they were sn-
occeano.

h. Where it was northerly, Frisiacs, or Skrooaiooa-
Frisians in the north-west, Slavonians in the north-acet.
