4. The Finlanders call the Germana Scaea. This is
weighty.

On the other baud-

1. No clear distinction has ever been drawn between, aga,
an Angle of Snffolk and a sacac of Escae.

2. The Romans, who knew, for some parts at least, every
inch of the land occupied by the Saxons of Germany, as long
’ as there is reason for believing that they took their names
from German sources, never use the word Socors at all. lt is
strange to Gaesar, Strabo, Pliny, and Tacitus. (See note in
v. Cherusci). Ptolemy is the first who uses it.

3. A native name hy which the West-Saxons of Wam
called themselves, was Gewissas. This is well accounted for
by supposing it ιο be a British name in a German mouth.

4. Whencver we liud ¹a population called Saeua, we lind

Thus the so·calle‹l-

them in detail.

b. Those of Northeru Germany are West-plruli, Ost-pbali,
and Aayorie'.

5. 0f all such synonyme, Soaoa is the least German in
respect to its form, a fact which precludes us from admitting
the existence of a second langnnga but denying its applice-

belong to different languages, it cannot be said that of the ’

two-
o. Soron as opposed to Anyto is Gerrunio, and Asyla as
opposed to Saurea is noa-Germanic.
b. Nor yet can it be said of the most doubtful synonym of
the list, Olaurum· since the -οο, whether German or not, is
more German than anything in the form Saxon. ,

c. With such words as Nord-albingii, Wart-pheli, and Ang-
orii (=oarc'i), there is no doubt.

6. Whatever were the relations between the Anglcs and

Saxone, populations dpffercmly related were called Saxona.
Thus, the conquerors of the Slavonic country at present

called Saxony, the ancestors of the Saxona of Dresdeu aud 3
