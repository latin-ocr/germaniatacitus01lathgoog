lI. If the common Lithuanic character cf the Gothini and
Gothoues be admitted, the Gallus of the Swedish district of
Gotllaed may bc considered.

When two populatione of the same name occupy the op-
posite sides of a sea of moderate breadth, it is reasonable to
suppose they are branchos of the same etech. l

Such is the case with the Goths of Gothland and the Go-
thones of Ocurland.

This primo socie view may, of course, be set asidc by
certain facts.

Gertain facts ore against it here. These arc-

o. The present Norae character of the Swedes of Gothland.

b. The account of J ornandes. Ἴ

But (to set against this) the antiquity of the Swedes of
Gothland is doubtful, and—-

'Phe account of J ornandas is improbable.

My own belief is that the population from whom the
Swedish province of Goth-land tooh the clement doct, wera
no more the N erse ancestors of its present occupante, than the
people from whom the oounty of Dor-set took the clement
Dea, were Angla-Saxam so that, just as the Dor· in Dor-set
wasa Ocltio root (Durotriges) though -set was Saron, so was
the Goth· in Geli-land other than Nersa though -lcod was
Norae.

o. N e Scandinavian nemo in any of the early writers-the
chief of these being Jornandes—is more German than such
Angla-Saron words as Rem-iay, or Dor-sertem names of
which the second parts (any, and oeten) are Angla-Saron,
but the first pert (Kent-‚ Dor-l Kellia, dcet-ii, Dur-otriges.

d. No tradition proves more than the derivation of the Brit-
ons from erae, the grandson of Anchiscs; in other words,
montmercantin, Jornandes takes the place of Geoffrey ol
Monmouth.

e. No Germanic population is found with any form of the
root G-l, as its name, until it become an inhabitant of some

country so designated. ·
