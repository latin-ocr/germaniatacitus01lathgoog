3. Both were-according to the evidence-neither Ger· 1

man nor Sarmatiam since the 80001010 treated tho Go-
thini as olmoiyoaae, aud the AEatii spolie what Tacitus calls
Britisl.

Do these three points 01 connection establish an ethnolo-
gical affinity?

I will lay down what Ι conceive 10 bc 00 hypothesis capable
01 solving all, or nearly all, the difficulties 0010100 from what
may be called the pluri-proaem 01 the root (1-1, G-tl, in the
two names under consideration.

This 10 00 follows: the root, Get, was, in the case 01
the Slavouic and Litlmanian populations, in the same predi-
cameut with the root Gale, in the case 01 the Hellenic aud
Italian.

With the Hellenes, spuisse was the name 01 0 single popu·
101100 within what, in the eyes 01 0 Roman, constituted the
Helleuic area; aud the name was, almost certainly, 001100.

With the Italicus, it was the name, not only for that par-
ticular tribe, but for the collective Hellenas 0100.

Mutatio mutandis-With the Lithuaniaus the (ι’-1 (aa,
G-tt) was the name 01 0 single population within what, in the
eyes 01 0 Slavonian, constituted the Lithuanic area, and the
name was, almost certainly, native.

With the Slavonians it was the name 001 only 01 that
particular tribe, but lor the collective Litlaooioas also.

Thus—the AEstii 01 Tacitus, the Basia 01 the Germano,
were called Gottoues (Gethones) by the more northern
Slavonians 01 their frontier; just os the Γξαῒκοι 01 Epirus
were called Greci by the Italians 01 11ιο 00000110 coast.

And, the Gallici 01 Tacitus were called by a similar name
by the more southern Slavonians 01 their frontier, just 00 the
Athenian Hellenas aud others were called Greci hythe
Roman, Campaniae, and other ltaliaus.

Such is the hypothesis. lprefer this to believing that the
Gotloucs and Gotlioi were so much and so thoroughly oue
and the aomo 0001100 01 the same brooch 00 lor them to have
borne the same name from Gallicia to Ocurland; in other
