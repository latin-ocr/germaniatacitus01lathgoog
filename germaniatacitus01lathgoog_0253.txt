XXXII. Proximi Chattis certum jam alveo Rhe-
num, quique terminus esse sufficiat, Usipii¹ ac Tencteri²
colunt. Tencteri super solitum bellorum decus eque-
stris disciplinae arte precellunt. Nec major apud
Chattos peditum laus, quim Tencteris equitum. Sic
instituere majores, posteri imitantur. Hi lusus in-
fantium, hacc juvenum aemulatio, perseverant senes:
inter familiam, et penates, et jura successionum, equi
traduntur: exeipit filius, non, ut cetera, maximus
natu, sed prout ferox bello et melior.

y ¹ Usipii.]-Another form of the word is [scip-dee.
lquite agree with Zeuss in his suggestion, that this -et, is the

Keltic sign of the plural, and that this is the meson why it occurs in
Gaesar throughout, whilst in Tacitus, it is the prevalent reading only
once (Ann. i. 51).

Caeser’s notice oi the Usipii takes precedence of all ethera He
places them on the Lower Rhine, making them conterminous (or
nearly so) with the Suari, Sicambri, Tencteri, Ubii, and Bructeri.

The graver complicatione begin with the notice of Ptolemy. A
population with a name so like Usipii aa Olt'orrol, is placed by that
writer aa far south as the frontier of the Helvetiae Desart-that is,
we identify the two names. The necessity, however, for doing so is

doubtful. The name is, probably, Gellio.

² Termi-The history oi the Tencteri ia nearly that of the
Usipii, and vioe arrad.

Pressed by the Saevi (Chatti) they crossed the Rhine 3 were defeated
by Caesar neor the junctiones the Maes3 end escaped, as a remnant,
by retracing their atepa, and repeating the Rhine to the country
of the Sigambri. Alina drawn dus east of Cologne, would pass
through the oripinal country ol the Ubii, Tencteri, and Usipii.
They were Gemens (ie, of the High German, or of the Platt-
Deutsch division) rather than Saxone or Trisians.

According to Dion and Florus, Drusus conquered tbe Tencteri
and Usipii on his way to the Chatti, the latter being on the northern
bank of the river Lippe. The complement to these two notes is
to be found iu the Epileponoeoo, §Vispi
