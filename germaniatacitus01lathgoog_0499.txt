Now the passages that prore the Varini 10 hare frequented
the Isle 01 Rugen‚ prove something more. They prove their
pagoniam. They prove, also, that some part of them were

longo a civitate illa, habens mars interjectum, quasi itinere
unius dici, Veranio nomine.”-“ Intellcrit ergo vir Dei, Varo-
oos evangelicas gratia indignos.''-“ Erant autem trans
mare barbari cmdelitate 01 saevitia singulares, q'ui Verani

dicebantur.”—Vit. Ottou. Episcopi Boll. Jul„ pp. 412, 413,
444.

Furthcr still-and this bears on the ethnology 01 the
Rugii-although it has been shown (Prolcyommo, p. xix.)
that tho -9·‚ in the name of the 1010 01 Rapsa, appearsas carly

The 17011111, then, are not to be considered 110910.
