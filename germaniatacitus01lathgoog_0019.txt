over the whole of scandinavia. Ohanges, however, set in.
In the three kingdoms they went on so as for two‚* or more,
new languages to have been evolved. ln lceland, however, the
contrary took place. The changes were so inconsiderable as
to leave the present Icelaudie nearly iu the same state in
which it was first introduced into the island; a fact which
has engendered the somcwhat lax statement of the Icehmde'e

The descent of the present Frisian is from the Old
Frisian; a language of which we have specimens as early
as the thirteenth century.

The descent of the present English is from the Anglo-

f Saxon; a language of which we have specimens asold as
the eighth century. ,

The descent of the present Dutch of Hclland is from the
Old Dutch; alanguage of which the oldest specimen is no
older than the thirtecuth century.

The descent of the present Platt·Deutsch is hom the old
dialects of the Lower Rhiue; the oldest specimens of which
are no older than the thirtecuth century.

The descent of the present High Gennan is from the old
dialects of Haase, Budas, Wnrtemburg, and Bavaria; the
oldest specimeus of which are asold as the eighth century.

Ι With these preliminaries, we lind that out of the existing
languages the majority can be traced upwards to a certain
point3 the Old High German further than the Low, the

s Frisiau as far as the Dutch, and the English further
than the Frisium a fact which leads us to speak of the
Old Frisisn as opposed to the Mlddle Frisian, and the
Mlddle Frisian as opposed to the Nes· and so ou through·
ont. But as this distinction is of subordinate importanoe iu
ethnology, it will not be further illustratcd.

Instead of pursuing it any longer let us sce what follows

ten dialects.
