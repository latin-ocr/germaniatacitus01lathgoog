to the Jutes of Iret-laud, one being a name iu oue dialect ol ¹

the Old Norse, the other iu another; just as, at present,
Gotlealory begins with G· in the mouth of a Daue, but with
Y· iu that of a Swede-Gliteuburg, Ylitenburg.

IV. le there any connection between the Getae of ulmea
and the Gothiui, the Gothouee, the GothlauderS, the J ut-
laudere, δια, all or auyi Iu puttiug this question, vve must
remember that the country of the Getae is the couutry of the
Getta aleo. ι

The difficulty involved hereiu, has already been iudi·
saled*

So has the explanation of the greatest Gothic scholar ἵ

living.

The present writer, in admittiug the difficulty, differs l

from Grimm, by admittiug the miyratioasrom Germane also.

But he believes that that migratiou vves not undertakeu
by Germane calling themselves Gotho.

He fiude uo evidence that they called themselves so before
they reached the country of the Geta.

They then took the name, aad not besem juet as the
Karai-inge of Angla-Sason Englaud took a name from the
Keltic county ol Kent.

This, however, is ouly a prelimiuery consideration. The
reel question is whether, or not, the similarity of name be·
tweeu the Get· of the Lower Danube aud the G-tli of
Gallicis aud Proseis be accidentali or ie it relerable to
ethuological connection!

ln this case, the distance ie sufficient to admit of the
resemblance to be accidentel ; aud Ι do uot prees the relation·
ship. Still l believe iu it.

The same Slavoniaus who, as froutagere, called the oue

chdoa, were the froutagers to the Geta also.
Iu this case the connexion iacebat, ia, it is of the same

sort which gives the same name to the Welel of Britain, y
and the Italicae, whom the Germane called Weleh also.

The Germanic populatione, which fill up the interval, agree
iu calling their aoroGermauic neighbonrs by some form of
the root W·l.
