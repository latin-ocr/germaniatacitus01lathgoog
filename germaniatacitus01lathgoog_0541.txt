liability to inundatione must not, however, be supposed to ο
indicate a locality in the (limbric chersoneso as well as a
German origin, since the coast between the Scheldt and Elbe
is as obnoxious to the ocean as the coasts of Holstein, Sles-
wick, and J utland. b.) That against the German Cimbri and
Teutones the Belgae alone kept their ground—olere μόνους

(sce above) with the interpolation Γερμάνων. o.) That they
inhabited their original country, and that they seut ambas·
sadors to Augustus—real γὰρ νῦν ἔχουσι τὴν χώραν ἣν εἶχον

weight must be given to the delinito character of this state·
ment.

Tacitae-Tacitus coincides with Strabo, in giving to the
Cimbri a specilic locality, end in stating special circumstances
of their history. Let full weight be given to the words of a
writer like Tacitus; but let it also be remembered that he
wrote from hearsay evidence, that he is anythiug rather than
an independent witness, that his statement is scarcely recon-
cilable with those of Ptolemy aud ansar, arrd that above all
the locality which both be and Strabo give the Oinoa· is
also the locality of the Sicambri, of which latter tribano
mention is made by Tacitus* although their wars with the
Romans were matters of comparatively recent history. For
my own part, Ithink, that between a eonfirsion of the
otmtrt with the Cimmerii on the one hand, and of the
Cimbri with the Sicambri on the other, we have the clue to
the misconceptions assumed at the commencement of the
paper. There is no proof that in the eyes of the writers
under the Republic, the origin of the Gimbri was a matter ol*
either doubt or speculation. Catulus, iu the History of his
Consulship, commendem by Gicero (Brutus, xxxa), and
Sylla in his Commentaries,'mnst have spoken of them in a
straightforward manner as Gauls, otherwise Cicero and

Sallust would have spoken of them less decidedly. (See
