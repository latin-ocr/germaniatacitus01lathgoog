ΙΙ. If the common Lithuanic character of the Gothini and

Gothones be admitted, the Gothe of the Swedish district of
Gothlund may be considered.

When two populations of the same name occupy tho op-
posite sides of a sca of moderate breadth‚ it is reasonable to
suppose they are branches of the sams stock.

Such is the case with the Gotho of Gothland and the Go-
thones of Oourland.

This primd socie view may, of course, be set aeide by
certain facte.

certain facts are against it here. These erc-

a. The present Norae character of the Swedes of Gothland.

h. The account of Jornandes.

But (to set against this) the antiquity of the Swedce of
Gothland is doubtful, and-

'I'he account of J ornandas is improbable.

My own belief is that the population from whom the
Swedieh province of Goth-land took the clement Goth, were
no more the Norse ancestors of its present occupante, than the
people from whom the oonnty of Dor-set took tho clement
Dor-, were Anglo-Saxon3 so that, just as the Dor· in Doceat
was a Oeltic root (Durotriges) though eet was Saron, so was
the Goth· in Goth-land other than Norse though -lood was
Norse.

o. No Scandinavian acme in any of the early writers-the
chief of these being Jornandcs-is more German than such
hogio-Saxon words ae Rem-ing, or Dor-satan,- names of
which the second parts (dap, and acetosa) are Anglo·Saxon‚
hut the first part (Kent-‚ Dor-) Kenio, Curat-ii, Dur-otriges.

b. No tradition proves more thau the derivation of the Brit-
one from Brut, the grandson of Anchiscs; in other words,
mutatis mutandis, Jornandes takes the placo of Geoffrey of
Monmouth.

c. No Germanic population is found with any formos the
root G-r, as its name, until it become an inhabitantes some

country so designated. ·
