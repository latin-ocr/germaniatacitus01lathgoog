his absence, few important events occurred, except that the

Bructeri defeated the legate, M. Lollius, destroyed his legion, ³
and captured the standands. After the return of Tiberius, ,

he received the command in Gaul, to complete the subju-
gation of Germany3 he penetrated ae far as the Elbe, and
reduced the Sigambri, Bructeri, and Cherusci, to obedienee.
On the Elbe, he was joined by the Roman fleet, which had
been fitted out on the river Eme, or had come from the
Rhine to the Eme. How it got up the Elbe cannen be ex-
plainod; it may have gone up as far as Magdeburg; and
yet the Roman galleys could not sail against the current,
like steam-boate. After thie campaign, Tiberius lest Ger-
many, ae his predecessore had done, and ae many of his
successore did aiter him; for the intention of the Romans
was merely to crush the Germane, not to put themselves
in possession of their country, which they ean hardly hare
thought worth the tmnble of occupying.

While the Germane, north of the Thilringer Wald and
about the Harz Monntains, were thus visited by the Romans,
thera existed in Bohemia the great kingdom of Maroboduus,
who ie estrange and mysterious phenomenon in the early
history of Germany. It is expressly stated that he had
a large town (Roriasmum) for his capital, a regular army
of seventy thousand men, and four thousand horscmen, a
body-guard, and definite political institutione. J uetus Moser
is perfectly right in saying that the Gennans, in the descrip-
’ tione of the Romans, must not be conceived of as more un-
civilined than the modern pensante of Weetphalia, or Lower
Saxony. 'l'heir dwelling-houses, ono thousand eight hundred
years ago, were, Ι believe, not different from the more oom-
mon ones in our own days, and the habitatione of their
chiefs were the earne aethe buildings of the middle ages.
The notion that the ancient Germane were savages is com-
pletely false3 they were neither more nor less than uncnl-
tivated country-people, to whom life in towns is altogether
unknown.

Venantius Fortunatus, in his poem to Radagunda, speahs
of the ruined magnificence of her father's empire, and the
hesse-covered palaces of her ancestors, the hings of Th‘dringia.
