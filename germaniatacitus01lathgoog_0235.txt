importauce. But what is that of the geographioal area now called
Bohemial So unknown was thet remarkable country to the Greeks
and Romans, that its obscurity was that ol' the central parts ol Africo
in our own tima There was a reason lor this. Its natural moun·
taio-rampart would preserve it hom invasion.

These same mountain-ramparts, however, which would thus tend
ιο keep the country inviolate, in the ease of a war, could hardly
escape notice aud description. Yet no such notices and decorus
tione exist osche present Bohamia, we find no amquloocal ae
count whatever in any Roman writer. Equioocat accounts we dc
find ε but these are got at by assuming the Marcomannic kingdom
ol' Maroboduus to have lain within Bohemis, and as they apply to
this Marcomannis kingdom only, they cesse ιο be Bohemian as soon
as the Marcomanni aro placed elsewhere

It may simplily the question ιο anticipato.

I believe the Boiolasm-am of Tacitus ιο have bean, not Boherma,
but Bovario.

Bovario and Bobenia are nearly the same words

a. The first element in sachis the proper name Bos‘s'. In the
sixth and sevsnth centuries the fuller formos Bavaria is Bojo-oria,
Bai-carra, Baybcrio, Boia-carii, dvo.

ι. The second clement is equivalent ia power, though not ιη sorva,
to the second element in Bo-laems'a. It is the word carminationes
or occupante in the Anglo-Saxon form, Ocatwcre=peopls os K aa.

Hence Bodemia=the Bos'aa computem Bcocria=ths occupent
Boiam.

This leads us ιο the lact that however much we may place the
Boii in Bobenia, we cannot do so ecclaeioely. As far as the name
goes, there were Boa's' in Bavaria as well 3 Boii, too, who ’ gave their
name to their land'

But this is not enough. We require substantive proof beyond ’

the inferenoe arising from the similarity of name for this latter fact.
At present the argument stands thus :-

Boiodem, in the time-of Tacitus, meent Bovario. Not so, may be
the answer. lt is granted that only one locality may bc intended
hythe two names, but why may not Bovario originally bava meant
Bohemial vhe answer to this must rest on ite own grounds.

Itis no small argument in favour ol the original single power
of the two names, to find that the alternative just indicated is a
real one. Zeuss expendo much learning upon it, giving reasons
