vnonnoousns. li

is a word of Roman make; one which never has been deve-
loped in the country itsclf.

That it is foreign we know3 and we know it because it
has been assigned within the memory of man. But what if
it had been assigned in the obscure days of the third and
fourth centuriesl It would undoubtedly have passed for
native.

At the same time Ι admit that, in order for one nation tc
adopt the name by wlu'ch it is known to another, there
must be a very favourable combination of circumstancest
au.-

u. There must be a considerable difference in the power
of the two populations: the vveaker taking the name from
tho stronger only when the fact of its relative weakness
is evident.

d. Or there must be intermixture.

c. Or there must be more than one nation to use the
foreign term, whilst only one upholds the native.

Ocntrary to many, l am dissatisfied with the evidence which
makes two very important words native and German-
statio (Suari) and Samon. I think each of these was di-
rectly Ileosca, and remotely Keltic. Hence, to the objection
against their uec-Germanic character, founded upon their
undoubted adoption by undoubted German populations, l
suggest the fact that their adoption was favoured by the
support of two languages (the Roman and the Keltic) against
the German single-handed.

More specillo reasons will be found in the sequel* At
present Ι merely illustrate aline of criticism.

§xvh thlTATIONS m THE WAY OF mmonoor.

The etymology of national names is generally considered
a powerful instrument in ethnological research.

It is doubtful, however, whether much hasbeen done by it.

Few writers ¹admit any one's etymologies but their own.
This is a proof of the arbitrary methcd in which the practice
is carried out.
