exactly coincide with the area of the British lauguagc, it is
not an isolated instance.

In the time of Tacitus the parts between Moravia, Gel-
licia, and Hungary were occupied by natione speaking three
different lauguages-the German, the Pannonica linqua of
Tacitus, and the Gallica liayuu of Tacitus. Α

At the present time three tongues meet in the seme parts
-the German, the Slcvak, and the Polish of Gallicis, the
Majiar of Hungery being a fourthr but that is of late intro·
duction.

Now if we assume much migration for these parts, the
migration must have been of the peculiur kind just indicated,
a chemical migration, so to say, a migration plue substi-
tution and replaeement3 a migratiou which, whatever it did
in the way of an indiscriminate abolition of all nationality, at
least lest the boundaries of three different leuguegea and
their geographical relations tc each other, much es it found
them.

Gertain writers, however (as already stated), adopt the view
cf a German migraticn from the parts between the Elbe and
Vistula sufficieutly exhaustive of the original population to
leave the country in a state of emptiness for the Slavcnians of
the parts farther eastwards to fill up. These, as they borrow
their notion of a uacuum from the science cf physice, may
take their theory of replacement aud substitution hcm the
chemist. Vulcatqucatnm.

Such the displacement. Whence came those who affected
itl Not from the country cest of the Guttones. There were
nc such Slavcnians thero. East of the Guttonee (the supposed
frontier people of Germmy), the populations were wholly
either Lithuauic or Finnic until the lest few centuriae, and
are nearly so now. This, then, is uo birthpluce for the
Slavcnians of Mecklenburg and Pomerania.

Did they come from the south-ia, from Bohemial Nc !
Echemus, according to the hypothesis, was German, besides
which, their leuguage was, probably, lese like the Bohemian
than the Polish.

Theu they came from Polandl Not even this. Poland

was occupied by Lygian Germana. d
