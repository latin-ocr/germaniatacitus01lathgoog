Another remark of N iebuhr‘s upon St. J erome's statement
is exceptionable. He considers that the supposed German of
Phrygia was introduced by the Goths of the reign of Theo·
dosius. Now their language would be Meso-Gothi03 at
least, as different from the German of the Lower Rhine, the
only German likely to be spoken at Treves, as the present
Dutch is from the Higb German of Switzerland and Bavarr'a
This difference is that of two mutually unintelligible tongues.

The supposed descent of the Nervii fromthe Teutones and
Gimbri, complicated as it is by the similar claim on the part
of the Aduatici (see not. in v. Neruii) is available only in the
hands of a writer who ean throw any light over the deep
gloom that invests the history of those famous warriorS.

Still, there is the evidence of Tacitus to their being less
Gallio, and more German than the typical Gauls.

This evidence we shall find is a reproduotion of that of
Gaesar—-for which see Prolepomeao, p. lxxii—where the
two chief texts are marked in Italics, Belgas esse ortos ab
Germanis, and Paemaoos qui orto aomim emmer· appellantur.

Το this-as an argument the seme way-we may add the
present existence of the Flemish language in Belgium sub-
ject to the certainty of Flanders having been conquered by
the Franks in the time of Glovis, and the likelihood of their
language having been then (and uo earlier) introduced.

Such is the evidence on one side. Agaiust it must be
placed the general tone of Gaesar's narrative, where the identi-

fication of the Belga with the Gauls in all essentiale, stands in ’

opposition to the exceptional statements as to the particular
Germaniam of the Parmani, bre.

But this is, perhaps, neutralized by the fact of his treating
the Aquitaniam who belonged to the Iberio stoek, in a similar
manner, ia, as Gauls.

The presence ol Belgae in Britain, is also in favour of the ¹

Belga being Gauls; since the evidence of Gerraoas on the
other side of the Gbannel, in the time of Gaesar, is eminently
imperfect, ie, the legitimate evidence. 0f course, by making
the Belgae of the Continent German, we ean bring Germane
